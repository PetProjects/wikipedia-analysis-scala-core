Anarchism

Anarchism is a <a href="political%20philosophy">political philosophy</a> that advocates <a href="self-governance">self-governed</a> societies based on voluntary institutions. These are often described as <a href="stateless%20society">stateless societies</a>, although several authors have defined them more specifically as institutions based on non-<a href="Hierarchy">hierarchical</a> <a href="Free%20association%20%28communism%20and%20anarchism%29">free associations</a>. Anarchism holds the <a href="state%20%28polity%29">state</a> to be undesirable, unnecessary, and harmful.

While <a href="anti-statism">anti-statism</a> is central, anarchism generally entails opposing <a href="authority">authority</a> or <a href="hierarchical%20organization">hierarchical organisation</a> in the conduct of all human relations, including, but not limited to, the state system. Anarchism is usually considered a radical <a href="left-wing">left-wing</a> ideology, and much of <a href="anarchist%20economics">anarchist economics</a> and <a href="anarchist%20law">anarchist legal philosophy</a> reflects <a href="Libertarian%20socialism">anti-authoritarian interpretations</a> of <a href="anarcho-communism">communism</a>, <a href="collectivist%20anarchism">collectivism</a>, <a href="anarcho-syndicalism">syndicalism</a>, <a href="Mutualism%20%28economic%20theory%29">mutualism</a>, or <a href="participatory%20economics">participatory economics</a>.

Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. Many types and traditions of anarchism exist, not all of which are mutually exclusive. <a href="Anarchist%20schools%20of%20thought">Anarchist schools of thought</a> can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme <a href="individualism">individualism</a> to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of <a href="social%20anarchism">social</a> and <a href="individualist%20anarchism">individualist anarchism</a> or similar dual classifications.

Etymology and terminology.
The term "<a href="wikt%3Aanarchism">anarchism</a>" is a compound word composed from the word "<a href="anarchy">anarchy</a>" and the suffix "<a href="-ism">-ism</a>", themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. "anarchy" (from , "anarchos", meaning "one without rulers"; from the <a href="privative">privative</a> prefix <a href="privative%20alpha">ἀν</a>- ("an-", i.e. "without") and , "archos", i.e. "leader", "ruler"; (cf. "<a href="archon">archon</a>" or , "arkhē", i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")) and the suffix or ("-ismos", "-isma", from the verbal <a href="infinitive">infinitive</a> suffix -ίζειν, "-izein"). The first known use of this word was in 1539. Various factions within the <a href="French%20Revolution">French Revolution</a> labelled opponents as anarchists (as <a href="Maximilien%20de%20Robespierre">Robespierre</a> did the <a href="H%C3%A9bertists">Hébertists</a>) although few shared many views of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as <a href="William%20Godwin">William Godwin</a> and <a href="Wilhelm%20Weitling">Wilhelm Weitling</a>, but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs.

The first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist was <a href="Pierre-Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre-Joseph Proudhon</a>, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s, and beginning in France, the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use "<a href="libertarianism">libertarianism</a>" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as "<a href="libertarian%20anarchism">libertarian anarchism</a>".

History.
Origins.
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of <a href="Taoism">Taoist</a> philosopher <a href="Laozi">Laozi</a>, and in later centuries by <a href="Zhuang%20Zhou">Zhuangzi</a> and Bao Jingyan. Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. Zhuangzi wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail. A great <a href="wikt%3Abrigand">brigand</a> becomes a ruler of a Nation." <a href="Diogenes%20of%20Sinope">Diogenes of Sinope</a> and the <a href="Cynicism%20%28philosophy%29">Cynics</a>, and their contemporary <a href="Zeno%20of%20Citium">Zeno of Citium</a>, the founder of <a href="Stoicism">Stoicism</a>, also introduced similar topics. <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the <a href="Christian%20anarchism">Christian anarchist</a> tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote that "The true founder of anarchy was <a href="Jesus">Jesus</a> <a href="Christ%20%28title%29">Christ</a> and ... the first anarchist society was that of the <a href="Apostle%20%28Christian%29">apostles</a>." In early <a href="History%20of%20Islam">Islamic history</a>, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the <a href="Second%20Fitna">Islamic civil war</a> over the <a href="Caliphate">Caliphate</a>, where the <a href="Kharijites">Kharijites</a> insisted that the <a href="imamate">imamate</a> is a right for each individual within the Islamic society. Later, some <a href="Muslim">Muslim</a> scholars, such as Amer al-Basri and <a href="Abu%20Hanifa">Abu Hanifa</a>, led movements of boycotting the rulers, paving the way to the <a href="waqf">waqf</a> (endowments) tradition, which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralised authorities of the emirs. But such interpretations reverberate subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not <a href="Anarchism%20and%20religion">anarchism and religion are compatible</a>. This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful <a href="idolatry">idolatry</a>.

The French <a href="Renaissance%20humanism">renaissance</a> political philosopher <a href="%C3%89tienne%20de%20La%20Bo%C3%A9tie">Étienne de La Boétie</a> wrote in his most famous work the "Discourse on Voluntary Servitude" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent. The radical <a href="Protestant%20Christianity">Protestant Christian</a> <a href="Gerrard%20Winstanley">Gerrard Winstanley</a> and his group the Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the <a href="English%20Civil%20War">English Civil War</a>, as a <a href="Pejorative">term of abuse</a>, used by <a href="Cavalier">Royalists</a> against their <a href="Roundhead">Roundhead</a> opponents. By the time of the French Revolution some, such as the "<a href="Enrag%C3%A9s">Enragés</a>", began to use the term positively, in opposition to <a href="Jacobin%20%28politics%29">Jacobin</a> centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as <a href="oxymoron">oxymoron</a>ic. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.

Modern anarchism emerged from the secular or religious thought of the <a href="Age%20of%20Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, particularly <a href="Jean-Jacques%20Rousseau">Jean-Jacques Rousseau</a>'s arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.

As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the French Revolution, William Godwin developed the first expression of modern anarchist thought. Godwin was, according to <a href="Peter%20Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>, "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work", while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early <a href="Edmund%20Burke">Edmund Burke</a>.
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.

His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people's 'mental enslavement', the foundations of law, <a href="property%20rights">property rights</a> and even the institution of marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgement.

The French Pierre-Joseph Proudhon is regarded as the first "self-proclaimed" anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, "<a href="What%20is%20Property%3F">What is Property?</a>", published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. He developed the theory of <a href="spontaneous%20order">spontaneous order</a> in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order." In "What is Property?" Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "<a href="Property%20is%20theft">Property is theft</a>." In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" ("propriété"), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish. He contrasted this with what he called "possession," or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that "Property is Liberty," and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.

The anarcho-communist <a href="Joseph%20D%C3%A9jacque">Joseph Déjacque</a> was the first person to describe himself as "libertarian". Unlike Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature." In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher <a href="Max%20Stirner">Max Stirner</a> published the book, "<a href="The%20Ego%20and%20Its%20Own">The Ego and Its Own</a>", which would later be considered an influential early text of individualist anarchism. French anarchists active in the <a href="1848%20Revolution">1848 Revolution</a> included <a href="Anselme%20Bellegarrigue">Anselme Bellegarrigue</a>, Ernest Coeurderoy, Joseph Déjacque and <a href="Pierre%20Joseph%20Proudhon">Pierre Joseph Proudhon</a>.

First International and the Paris Commune.
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the <a href="revolutions%20of%201848">revolutions of 1848</a>, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt. In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal "El Porvenir" in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon´s ideas. The <a href="Catalan%20people">Catalan</a> politician <a href="Francesc%20Pi%20i%20Margall">Francesc Pi i Margall</a> became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to George Woodcock "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's." According to the "<a href="Encyclop%C3%A6dia%20Britannica">Encyclopædia Britannica</a>" "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall <a href="Cantonal%20Revolution">attempted to establish a decentralised, or "cantonalist," political system</a> on Proudhonian lines."

In 1864 the <a href="International%20Workingmen%27s%20Association">International Workingmen's Association</a> (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of Proudhon, <a href="Blanquism">Blanquists</a>, <a href="Philadelphes">Philadelphes</a>, English trade unionists, socialists and <a href="social%20democrats">social democrats</a>. Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation. <a href="Karl%20Marx">Karl Marx</a> became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the mutualists, opposed Marx's <a href="state%20socialism">state socialism</a>, advocating political <a href="abstentionism">abstentionism</a> and small property holdings. Woodcock also reports that the American individualist anarchists <a href="Lysander%20Spooner">Lysander Spooner</a> and <a href="William%20B.%20Greene">William B. Greene</a> had been members of the <a href="First%20International">First International</a>. In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the <a href="League%20of%20Peace%20and%20Freedom">League of Peace and Freedom</a> (LPF), Russian revolutionary Mikhail Bakunin and his collectivist anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF). They allied themselves with the <a href="federalist">federalist</a> socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivisation of property.

At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. <a href="Mikhail%20Bakunin">Mikhail Bakunin</a> characterised Marx's ideas as <a href="centralism">centralist</a> and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the <a href="ruling%20class">ruling class</a> they had fought against. Anarchist historian George Woodcock reports that "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers." In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the <a href="Hague%20Congress%20%281872%29">Hague Congress</a>, where Bakunin and <a href="James%20Guillaume">James Guillaume</a> were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the <a href="Anarchist%20St.%20Imier%20International">St. Imier Congress</a>, adopting a revolutionary anarchist programme.

The <a href="Paris%20Commune">Paris Commune</a> was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included <a href="Louise%20Michel">Louise Michel</a>, the Reclus brothers, and <a href="Eugene%20Varlin">Eugene Varlin</a> (the latter murdered in the repression afterwards). As for the reforms initiated by the Commune, such as the re-opening of workplaces as co-operatives, anarchists can see their ideas of associated labour beginning to be realised ... Moreover, the Commune's ideas on federation obviously reflected the influence of Proudhon on French radical ideas. Indeed, the Commune's vision of a communal France based on a federation of delegates bound by imperative mandates issued by their electors and subject to recall at any moment echoes Bakunin's and Proudhon's ideas (Proudhon, like Bakunin, had argued in favour of the "implementation of the binding mandate" in 1848 ... and for federation of communes). Thus both economically and politically the Paris Commune was heavily influenced by anarchist ideas. George Woodcock states:

Organised labour.
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organization of labour." In 1886, the <a href="Federation%20of%20Organized%20Trades%20and%20Labor%20Unions">Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions</a> (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the <a href="Eight-hour%20day">eight-hour work day</a> would become standard.

In response, unions across the United States prepared a <a href="general%20strike">general strike</a> in support of the event. On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when <a href="strikebreaker">strikebreaker</a>s attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the Haymarket affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorialising workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of <a href="International%20Workers%27%20Day">International Workers' Day</a> on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.

In 1907, the <a href="International%20Anarchist%20Congress%20of%20Amsterdam">International Anarchist Congress of Amsterdam</a> gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including <a href="Errico%20Malatesta">Errico Malatesta</a>, <a href="Pierre%20Monatte">Pierre Monatte</a>, <a href="Luigi%20Fabbri">Luigi Fabbri</a>, <a href="Beno%C3%AEt%20Broutchoux">Benoît Broutchoux</a>, <a href="Emma%20Goldman">Emma Goldman</a>, <a href="Rudolf%20Rocker">Rudolf Rocker</a>, and <a href="Christiaan%20Cornelissen">Christiaan Cornelissen</a>. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, <a href="popular%20education">popular education</a> issues, the general strike or <a href="antimilitarism">antimilitarism</a>. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and <a href="syndicalism">syndicalism</a> (or <a href="trade%20union">trade union</a>ism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a <a href="social%20revolution">social revolution</a>, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade-union movement was <a href="reformism">reformist</a> and even <a href="Conservatism">conservative</a>, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.

The <a href="Federaci%C3%B3n%20Anarquista%20Ib%C3%A9rica">Spanish Workers Federation</a> in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20Nacional%20del%20Trabajo">Confederación Nacional del Trabajo</a> (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the <a href="Spanish%20Civil%20War">Spanish Civil War</a>. The CNT was affiliated with the <a href="International%20Workers%20Association">International Workers Association</a>, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular "The anarchists quickly became active in organising craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Mexico">Mexico</a>, <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Brazil">Brazil</a>, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organisation was undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organisations was the <a href="Federaci%C3%B3n%20Obrera%20Regional%20Argentina">Federación Obrera Regional Argentina</a> ... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions."
Propaganda of the deed and illegalism.
Some anarchists, such as <a href="Johann%20Most">Johann Most</a>, advocated publicising violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda." Scholars such as Beverly Gage contend that this was not advocacy of mass murder, but <a href="targeted%20killings">targeted killings</a> of members of the ruling class at times when such actions might garner sympathy from the population, such as during heightened government repression and labor conflicts where workers were killed. However, Most himself once boasted that "the existing system will be quickest and most radically overthrown by the annihilation of its exponents. Therefore, massacres of the enemies of the people must be set in motion." Most is best known for a pamphlet published in 1885: "The Science of Revolutionary Warfare", a how-to manual on the subject of making explosives, based on knowledge he acquired while working at an explosives plant in New Jersey.

By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, <a href="regicide">regicide</a>s, and <a href="tyrannicide">tyrannicide</a>s. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal '<a href="Confiscation">expropriations</a>'." <a href="Illegalism">Illegalism</a> as a practice emerged and within it "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("<a href="propaganda%20by%20the%20deed">propaganda by the deed</a>") and the anarchist burglars ("<a href="individual%20reappropriation">individual reappropriation</a>") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be "exemplary" invitations to revolt.". France's <a href="Bonnot%20Gang">Bonnot Gang</a> was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.

However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. Peter Kropotkin thus wrote that year in "Le Révolté" that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the trade union movement. The anarcho-syndicalist, <a href="Fernand%20Pelloutier">Fernand Pelloutier</a>, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."

<a href="Political%20repression">State repression</a> (including the infamous 1894 French "<a href="lois%20sc%C3%A9l%C3%A9rates">lois scélérates</a>") of the anarchist and <a href="labour%20movement">labour movement</a>s following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French <a href="socialist%20movement">socialist movement</a>, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 Paris Commune, the execution and exile of many "<a href="communards">communards</a>" to <a href="penal%20colonies">penal colonies</a>, favoured individualist political expression and acts.

Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement, including Tsar <a href="Alexander%20II%20of%20Russia">Alexander II of Russia</a>, President <a href="Marie%20Fran%C3%A7ois%20Sadi%20Carnot">Sadi Carnot</a> of France, <a href="Empress%20Elisabeth%20of%20Austria">Empress Elisabeth of Austria</a>, King <a href="Umberto%20I%20of%20Italy">Umberto I of Italy</a>, President <a href="William%20McKinley">William McKinley</a> of the United States, King <a href="Carlos%20I%20of%20Portugal">Carlos I of Portugal</a> and King <a href="George%20I%20of%20Greece">George I of Greece</a>. McKinley's assassin <a href="Leon%20Czolgosz">Leon Czolgosz</a> claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and <a href="feminist">feminist</a> Emma Goldman.

Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the <a href="1917%20October%20Revolution">1917 October Revolution</a>.

Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s.
Anarchists participated alongside the <a href="Bolshevik">Bolshevik</a>s in both <a href="February%20Revolution">February</a> and <a href="October%20Revolution">October revolutions</a>, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution. However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 <a href="Kronstadt%20rebellion">Kronstadt rebellion</a>, which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>. There, in the <a href="Free%20Territory%20%28Ukraine%29">Free Territory</a>, they fought in the <a href="Russian%20Civil%20War">civil war</a> against the <a href="White%20movement">Whites</a> (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine led by Nestor Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.

Expelled American anarchists Emma Goldman and <a href="Alexander%20Berkman">Alexander Berkman</a> were among those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the Kronstadt uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, Bakunin's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.

The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; <a href="Communist%20party">Communist parties</a> grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the <a href="Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20g%C3%A9n%C3%A9rale%20du%20travail">CGT</a> and <a href="Industrial%20Workers%20of%20the%20World">IWW</a> left the organisations and joined the <a href="Comintern">Communist International</a>.

The <a href="Revolutions%20of%201917%E2%80%9323">revolutionary wave of 1917–23</a> saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the <a href="German%20Revolution%20of%201918%E2%80%931919">German Revolution of 1918–1919</a> which established the <a href="Bavarian%20Soviet%20Republic">Bavarian Soviet Republic</a> the anarchists <a href="Gustav%20Landauer">Gustav Landauer</a>, <a href="Silvio%20Gesell">Silvio Gesell</a> and <a href="Erich%20M%C3%BChsam">Erich Mühsam</a> had important leadership positions within the revolutionary <a href="Council%20communism">councilist</a> structures. In the Italian events known as the "<a href="biennio%20rosso">biennio rosso</a>" the anarcho-syndicalist trade union <a href="Unione%20Sindacale%20Italiana">Unione Sindacale Italiana</a> "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus "<a href="Umanita%20Nova">Umanita Nova</a>", its daily paper) grew accordingly ... Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces. In the <a href="Mexican%20Revolution">Mexican Revolution</a> the <a href="Mexican%20Liberal%20Party">Mexican Liberal Party</a> was established and during the early 1910s it led a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in <a href="Baja%20California">Baja California</a> with the leadership of anarcho-communist <a href="Ricardo%20Flores%20Mag%C3%B3n">Ricardo Flores Magón</a>.

In Paris, the <a href="Dielo%20Truda">Dielo Truda</a> group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included Nestor Makhno, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the "<a href="Platformism">Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)</a>", was supported. <a href="Platformist">Platformist</a> groups active today include the <a href="Workers%20Solidarity%20Movement">Workers Solidarity Movement</a> in Ireland and the <a href="NEFAC">North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists</a> of North America. <a href="Synthesis%20anarchism">Synthesis anarchism</a> emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of <a href="anarchism%20without%20adjectives">anarchism without adjectives</a>. In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents <a href="Volin">Volin</a> and <a href="Sebastien%20Faure">Sebastien Faure</a>. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a>.

Conflicts with European fascist regimes.
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Italy">Italian anarchists</a> played a key role in the <a href="Anti-fascism">anti-fascist</a> organisation "<a href="Arditi%20del%20Popolo">Arditi del Popolo</a>", which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling <a href="Blackshirts">Blackshirts</a> in the anarchist stronghold of <a href="Parma">Parma</a> in August 1922. The veteran Italian anarchist, Luigi Fabbri, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution." In France, where the <a href="far%20right%20leagues">far right leagues</a> came close to insurrection in the <a href="6%20February%201934%20crisis">February 1934 riots</a>, anarchists divided over a <a href="united%20front">united front</a> policy.

Anarchists in <a href="Anarchism%20in%20France">France</a> and Italy were active in the <a href="Resistance%20during%20World%20War%20II">Resistance during World War II</a>. In Germany the anarchist Erich Mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the <a href="Reichstag%20fire">Reichstag fire</a> in Berlin. <a href="Joseph%20Goebbels">Joseph Goebbels</a>, the Nazi <a href="Propagandaministerium">propaganda minister</a>, labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives." Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at <a href="Sonnenburg">Sonnenburg</a>, Brandenburg and finally, <a href="Oranienburg">Oranienburg</a>. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the <a href="Nazi%20concentration%20camps">concentration camp</a> at <a href="Oranienburg%20concentration%20camp">Oranienburg</a> when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.

Spanish Revolution.
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union Confederación Nacional del Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, conservative members of the military, with the support of minority extreme-right parties, responded with an attempted coup, causing the Spanish Civil War (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Spain">anarchist-inspired</a> movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of <a href="Barcelona">Barcelona</a> and of large areas of rural Spain where they <a href="Collective%20farming">collectivised</a> the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the <a href="Stalinism">Stalinists</a>, who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the <a href="Soviet%20Union">Soviet Union</a>. According to <a href="Noam%20Chomsky">Noam Chomsky</a>, "the communists were mainly responsible for the destruction of the Spanish anarchists. Not just in Catalonia—the communist armies mainly destroyed the collectives elsewhere. The communists basically acted as the police force of the security system of the Republic and were very much opposed to the anarchists, partially because Stalin still hoped at that time to have some kind of pact with Western countries against Hitler. That, of course, failed and Stalin withdrew the support to the Republic. They even withdrew the Spanish gold reserves." The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' social revolution that began during the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of anarchist and more broadly <a href="libertarian%20socialist">libertarian socialist</a> organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily <a href="Catalonia">Catalonia</a>, <a href="Anarchist%20Aragon">Aragon</a>, <a href="Andalusia">Andalusia</a>, and parts of <a href="Levante%2C%20Spain">the Levante</a>. Much of <a href="Spain%27s%20economy">Spain's economy</a> was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy <a href="Communist%20Party%20of%20Spain%20%28main%29">Communist Party of Spain</a> influence, as the Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at <a href="collectivisation">collectivisation</a> enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, <a href="agriculture">agrarian</a> areas became collectivised and run as libertarian <a href="commune%20%28intentional%20community%29">communes</a>. Anarchist historian <a href="Sam%20Dolgoff">Sam Dolgoff</a> estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realising the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history." <a href="Spanish%20Communist%20Party">Spanish Communist Party</a>-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both <a href="Workers%27%20Party%20of%20Marxist%20Unification">dissident Marxists</a> and anarchists. The prominent Italian anarchist <a href="Camillo%20Berneri">Camillo Berneri</a>, who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the Spanish Communist Party. The city of Madrid was turned over to the francoist forces by the last non-francoist mayor of the city, the anarchist <a href="Melchor%20Rodr%C3%ADguez%20Garc%C3%ADa">Melchor Rodríguez García</a>.

Post-war years.
Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between synthesis anarchism and platformism took importance once again especially in the <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Italy%23Postwar%20years%20and%20today">anarchist movements of Italy</a> and <a href="Anarchism%20in%20France%23The%20Fourth%20Republic%20%281945%E2%80%931958%29">France</a>. The <a href="Mexican%20Anarchist%20Federation">Mexican Anarchist Federation</a> was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District. In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association). From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime. In 1945 in France the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20Anarchiste">Fédération Anarchiste</a> and the anarchosyndicalist trade union <a href="Conf%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20nationale%20du%20travail">Confédération nationale du travail</a> was established in the next year while the also <a href="Synthesist%20anarchism">synthesist</a> <a href="Federazione%20Anarchica%20Italiana">Federazione Anarchica Italiana</a> was founded in Italy. Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the <a href="Japanese%20Anarchist%20Federation">Japanese Anarchist Federation</a> was founded. An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948. After World War II, an appeal in the "<a href="Fraye%20Arbeter%20Shtime">Fraye Arbeter Shtime</a>" detailing the plight of <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Germany">German anarchists</a> and called for Americans to support them. By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and Rudolf Rocker wrote for its organ, "Die Freie Gesellschaft", which survived until 1953. In 1956 the <a href="Uruguayan%20Anarchist%20Federation">Uruguayan Anarchist Federation</a> was founded. In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the <a href="Argentine%20Libertarian%20Federation">Argentine Libertarian Federation</a>. The <a href="Syndicalist%20Workers%27%20Federation">Syndicalist Workers' Federation</a> was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of <a href="Solidarity%20Federation">Solidarity Federation</a>'s earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain. Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.

Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as <a href="Albert%20Camus">Albert Camus</a>, <a href="Herbert%20Read">Herbert Read</a>, Paul Goodman, Dwight Macdonald, <a href="Allen%20Ginsberg">Allen Ginsberg</a>, George Woodcock, <a href="Leopold%20Kohr">Leopold Kohr</a>, <a href="Julian%20Beck">Julian Beck</a>, <a href="John%20Cage">John Cage</a> and the French <a href="Surrealism">Surrealist</a> group led by <a href="Andr%C3%A9%20Breton">André Breton</a>, which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the Fédération Anarchiste.

<a href="Anarcho-pacifism">Anarcho-pacifism</a> became influential in the <a href="Anti-nuclear%20movement">Anti-nuclear movement</a> and <a href="anti%20war%20movement">anti war movement</a>s of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of <a href="Campaign%20for%20Nuclear%20Disarmament">Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament</a> <a href="Alex%20Comfort">Alex Comfort</a> or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists <a href="Ammon%20Hennacy">Ammon Hennacy</a> and <a href="Dorothy%20Day">Dorothy Day</a>. Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the <a href="Cold%20War">Cold War</a>." The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's , "Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)".

Contemporary anarchism.
 A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Anarchism was influential in the <a href="Counterculture%20of%20the%201960s">Counterculture of the 1960s</a> and anarchists actively participated in the <a href="Protests%20of%201968">late sixties students and workers revolts</a>. In 1968 in <a href="Carrara">Carrara</a>, Italy the <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a> was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the <a href="F%C3%A9d%C3%A9ration%20anarchiste">Fédération Anarchiste</a>), the Federazione Anarchica Italiana of Italy and the <a href="Iberian%20Anarchist%20Federation">Iberian Anarchist Federation</a> as well as the <a href="Bulgaria">Bulgaria</a>n federation in French exile.

In the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the <a href="punk%20rock">punk rock</a> movement, as exemplified by bands such as <a href="Crass">Crass</a> and the <a href="Sex%20Pistols">Sex Pistols</a>. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of communes and squatter movements like that of Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, <a href="squatter">squatter</a>s occupied a disused military base and declared the <a href="Freetown%20Christiania">Freetown Christiania</a>, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid-20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of <a href="anarcha-feminism">anarcha-feminism</a>, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist <a href="David%20Graeber">David Graeber</a> and anarchist historian <a href="Andrej%20Grubacic">Andrej Grubacic</a> have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by <a href="Traditional%20knowledge">indigenous</a>, <a href="feminism">feminist</a>, ecological and cultural-critical ideas", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.

Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and <a href="anti-globalisation%20movement">anti-globalisation movement</a>s. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization">World Trade Organization</a> (WTO), <a href="G8">Group of Eight</a>, and the <a href="World%20Economic%20Forum">World Economic Forum</a>. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as "<a href="black%20bloc">black bloc</a>s"; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include <a href="security%20culture">security culture</a>, <a href="affinity%20groups">affinity groups</a> and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at <a href="World%20Trade%20Organization%20Ministerial%20Conference%20of%201999%20protest%20activity">WTO conference in Seattle in 1999</a>. According to anarchist scholar <a href="Simon%20Critchley">Simon Critchley</a>, "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary <a href="neo-liberalism">neo-liberalism</a> ... One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally."

International anarchist federations in existence include the <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a>, the <a href="International%20Workers%27%20Association">International Workers' Association</a>, and <a href="International%20Libertarian%20Solidarity">International Libertarian Solidarity</a>.
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the <a href="Confederaci%C3%B3n%20General%20del%20Trabajo">Confederación General del Trabajo</a> (CGT) and the CNT. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003. Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the <a href="Central%20Organisation%20of%20the%20Workers%20of%20Sweden">Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden</a> and the <a href="Swedish%20Anarcho-syndicalist%20Youth%20Federation">Swedish Anarcho-syndicalist Youth Federation</a>; the CNT-AIT in France; the Unione Sindicale Italiana in Italy; in the US <a href="Workers%20Solidarity%20Alliance">Workers Solidarity Alliance</a> and the UK Solidarity Federation and <a href="Anarchist%20Federation%20%28Britain%20and%20Ireland%29">Anarchist Federation</a>. The revolutionary industrial unionist Industrial Workers of the World, claiming 3,000 paying members, and the International Workers Association, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.

Anarchist schools of thought.
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, individualist anarchism and <a href="social%20anarchism">social anarchism</a>, which have some different origins, values and evolution. The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises <a href="negative%20liberty">negative liberty</a>, i.e. opposition to state or <a href="social%20control">social control</a> over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise <a href="positive%20liberty">positive liberty</a> to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfil, "recognising equality of entitlement". In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.

Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is <a href="philosophical%20anarchism">philosophical anarchism</a>, which embodies the theoretical stance that the state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a <a href="minarchism">minimal state</a> as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a <a href="moral%20obligation">moral obligation</a> to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "anarchism without adjectives", a call for <a href="toleration">toleration</a> first adopted by <a href="Fernando%20Tarrida%20del%20M%C3%A1rmol">Fernando Tarrida del Mármol</a> in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time. In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the <a href="anti-authoritarian">anti-authoritarian</a> beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.

Classical anarchist schools of thought.
Mutualism.
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with Pierre-Joseph Proudhon in France and others in the United States. Proudhon proposed spontaneous order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order." Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with anarchist but socialist factions of workers' movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalisation schemes during his life of public service.

Mutualist anarchism is concerned with <a href="Reciprocity%20%28cultural%20anthropology%29">reciprocity</a>, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist <a href="William%20Batchelder%20Greene">William Batchelder Greene</a>, each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount." Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property."

Individualist anarchism.
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasise the <a href="individual">individual</a> and their <a href="will%20%28philosophy%29">will</a> over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems. Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.

In 1793, William Godwin, who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>", which some consider the first expression of anarchism. Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a <a href="rationalist">rationalist</a> and <a href="utilitarian">utilitarian</a> basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a <a href="Limited%20government">minimal state</a> as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.

An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism," or <a href="egoist%20anarchism">egoist anarchism</a>, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German Max Stirner. Stirner's "The Ego and Its Own", published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy. According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of individuals is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality. To Stirner, rights were "<a href="Reification%20%28fallacy%29">spooks</a>" in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality". Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw <a href="union%20of%20egoists">unions of egoists</a>, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the state. Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. "Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a> activist <a href="John%20Henry%20Mackay">John Henry Mackay</a>.

<a href="Josiah%20Warren">Josiah Warren</a> is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, "The Peaceful Revolutionist", was the first anarchist periodical published. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster "It is apparent ... that Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of Josiah Warren and <a href="Stephen%20Pearl%20Andrews">Stephen Pearl Andrews</a> ... William B. Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.". <a href="Henry%20David%20Thoreau">Henry David Thoreau</a> (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, <a href="Development%20criticism">development critic</a>, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading <a href="transcendentalist">transcendentalist</a>. He is best known for his books "<a href="Walden">Walden</a>", a reflection upon <a href="simple%20living">simple living</a> in natural surroundings, and his essay, "<a href="Civil%20Disobedience%20%28Thoreau%29">Civil Disobedience</a>", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later Benjamin Tucker fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication "<a href="Liberty%20%281881%E2%80%931908%29">Liberty</a>".

From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, <a href="free%20love">free love</a> and <a href="birth%20control">birth control</a> advocates (see <a href="Anarchism%20and%20issues%20related%20to%20love%20and%20sex">Anarchism and issues related to love and sex</a>), individualist <a href="Naturism">naturists</a> <a href="Nudism">nudists</a> (see <a href="anarcho-naturism">anarcho-naturism</a>), <a href="freethought">freethought</a> and <a href="Anti-clericalism">anti-clerical</a> activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as illegalism and <a href="individual%20reclamation">individual reclamation</a> (see <a href="European%20individualist%20anarchism">European individualist anarchism</a> and <a href="individualist%20anarchism%20in%20France">individualist anarchism in France</a>). These authors and activists included <a href="Oscar%20Wilde">Oscar Wilde</a>, <a href="Emile%20Armand">Emile Armand</a>, <a href="Han%20Ryner">Han Ryner</a>, <a href="Henri%20Zisly">Henri Zisly</a>, <a href="Renzo%20Novatore">Renzo Novatore</a>, <a href="Miguel%20Gimenez%20Igualada">Miguel Gimenez Igualada</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Brand">Adolf Brand</a> and <a href="Lev%20Chernyi">Lev Chernyi</a> among others.

Social anarchism.
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or <a href="coercion">coercion</a>. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism. Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for <a href="personal%20property">personal property</a>), and emphasises cooperation and <a href="mutual%20aid%20%28organization%29">mutual aid</a>.

Collectivist anarchism.
Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as "revolutionary socialism" or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with Mikhail Bakunin and Johann Most. Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or "propaganda by the deed", which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.

However, collectivisation was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by <a href="anarchist%20communists">anarchist communists</a> as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system". Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with <a href="Marxism">Marxism</a> but opposed the Marxist dictatorship of the proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society. Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not <a href="mutually%20exclusive">mutually exclusive</a>; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.

Anarcho-communism.
Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the state, <a href="market%20%28economics%29">market</a>s, money, <a href="private%20property">private property</a> (while retaining respect for personal property), and capitalism in favour of <a href="common%20ownership">common ownership</a> of the <a href="means%20of%20production">means of production</a>, <a href="direct%20democracy">direct democracy</a> and a horizontal network of <a href="voluntary%20association">voluntary association</a>s and <a href="workers%27%20council">workers' council</a>s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "<a href="from%20each%20according%20to%20his%20ability%2C%20to%20each%20according%20to%20his%20need">from each according to his ability, to each according to his need</a>".

Some forms of anarchist communism such as <a href="insurrectionary%20anarchism">insurrectionary anarchism</a> are strongly influenced by egoism and radical individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realisation of individual freedom. Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.

Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the First International. The theoretical work of Peter Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and insurrectionary anti-organisationalist sections. To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the <a href="Spanish%20Revolution%20of%201936">Spanish Revolution</a> and the <a href="Free%20Territory">Free Territory</a> during the <a href="Russian%20Revolution%20%281917%29">Russian Revolution</a>. Through the efforts and influence of the <a href="Spanish%20Anarchists">Spanish Anarchists</a> during the Spanish Revolution within the Spanish Civil War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of <a href="Anarchist%20Catalonia">Anarchist Catalonia</a> before being crushed by the combined forces of <a href="Francoism">the regime that won the war</a>, <a href="Adolf%20Hitler">Hitler</a>, Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as Nestor Makhno worked to create and defend – through the Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine – anarchist communism in the Free Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.

Anarcho-syndicalism.
Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the labour movement. Anarcho-syndicalists view labour unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' <a href="wikt%3ASolidarity">solidarity</a>, <a href="Direct%20action">Direct action</a> and <a href="Workers%27%20self-management">Workers' self-management</a>
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only direct action – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves. Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. Rudolf Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet "Anarcho-Syndicalism". The International Workers Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish Confederación Nacional del Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish labour movement. It was also an important force in the Spanish Civil War.

Syncretic anarchism.
The term syncretic anarchism was first coined by <a href="Alberto%20Frigo">Alberto Frigo</a> in relation to his reading of Jacques Ellul. Rephrasing the latter, Frigo observed that, if on one hand new technologies creates new form of power, on the other, new technologies are accompanied by the rise of what <a href="Marcel%20Mauss">Marcel Mauss</a> defines as magic. By developing the techniques to perform new magic and by adhering to it, marginal individuals come to create forms of syncretism which brings together the different dogmas and cultures a power structures uses to put humans against one another. The 19th century French postman <a href="Ferdinand%20Cheval">Ferdinand Cheval</a> for example, has intuitively experimented with the, at that time, new medium of cement, and created, after 33 years of adherence to certain rituals, a monument blending religions from around the world.

Post-classical schools of thought.
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and <a href="Syncretic%20politics">syncretic</a>, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.

<a href="Green%20anarchism">Green anarchism</a> (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasises environmental issues, with an important precedent in anarcho-naturism, and whose main contemporary currents are anarcho-primitivism and <a href="social%20ecology">social ecology</a>.

Anarcha-feminism (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with feminism. It generally views <a href="patriarchy">patriarchy</a> as a manifestation of involuntary coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by <a href="decentralised">decentralised</a> free association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of <a href="class%20struggle">class struggle</a>, and the anarchist struggle against the state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice versa. <a href="L.%20Susan%20Brown">L. Susan Brown</a> claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist". Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th-century writings of early feminist anarchists such as Emma Goldman and <a href="Voltairine%20de%20Cleyre">Voltairine de Cleyre</a>.

Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see <a href="non-violence">non-violence</a>). It developed "mostly in the <a href="Netherlands">Netherlands</a>, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War". Christian anarchism is a <a href="Christian%20movement">movement</a> in <a href="political%20theology">political theology</a> that combines anarchism and Christianity. Its main proponents included <a href="Leo%20Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a>, Dorothy Day, Ammon Hennacy, and <a href="Jacques%20Ellul">Jacques Ellul</a>.

Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of Dielo Truda's "Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)". The document was based on the experiences of <a href="Anarchism%20in%20Russia">Russian anarchists</a> in the 1917 October Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the <a href="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> over the anarchists and other groups. The "Platform" attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the Russian Revolution.

Synthesis anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of anarchism without adjectives. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the <a href="anarcho-communists">anarcho-communists</a> <a href="Voline">Voline</a> and <a href="S%C3%A9bastien%20Faure">Sébastien Faure</a>. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global <a href="International%20of%20Anarchist%20Federations">International of Anarchist Federations</a>.

Post-left anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional <a href="Left-wing%20politics">Left-wing politics</a>. Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of <a href="ideology">ideology</a> in general also presenting a critique of organisations and <a href="morality">morality</a>. Influenced by the work of Max Stirner and by the Marxist <a href="Situationist%20International">Situationist International</a>, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.

Insurrectionary anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasises <a href="insurrection">insurrection</a> within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organisations such as <a href="labour%20unions">labour unions</a> and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small <a href="affinity%20group">affinity group</a> based organisation. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent <a href="class%20conflict">class conflict</a>, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.

<a href="Post-anarchism">Post-anarchism</a> is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and <a href="poststructuralist">poststructuralist</a> thought, drawing from diverse ideas including <a href="post-modernism">post-modernism</a>, <a href="autonomist%20marxism">autonomist marxism</a>, post-left anarchy, Situationist International, and <a href="postcolonialism">postcolonialism</a>.

<a href="Left-wing%20market%20anarchism">Left-wing market anarchism</a> strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labour positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.

<a href="Anarcho-capitalism">Anarcho-capitalism</a> advocates the elimination of the state in favour of <a href="sovereign%20individual">individual sovereignty</a> in a <a href="free%20market">free market</a>. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state libertarianism and individualist anarchism, drawing from <a href="Austrian%20School">Austrian School</a> economics, study of <a href="law%20and%20economics">law and economics</a>, and <a href="public%20choice%20theory">public choice theory</a>. There is a strong current within anarchism which believes that anarcho-capitalism cannot be considered a part of the anarchist movement, due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an <a href="anti-capitalist">anti-capitalist</a> movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism as <a href="Anarchism%20and%20capitalism">incompatible</a> with capitalist forms.

Internal issues and debates.
Anarchism is a <a href="philosophy">philosophy</a> that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of capitalism, <a href="anarchism%20and%20nationalism">nationalism</a>, and religion with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as <a href="Anarchism%20and%20Marxism">Marxism</a>, <a href="Issues%20in%20anarchism%23Communism">communism</a>, <a href="collectivism">collectivism</a>, <a href="syndicalism">syndicalism</a>/<a href="trade%20unionism">trade unionism</a>, and capitalism. Anarchists may be motivated by <a href="humanism">humanism</a>, divine authority, <a href="enlightened%20self-interest">enlightened self-interest</a>, <a href="veganarchism">veganism</a> or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.

Phenomena such as <a href="civilisation">civilisation</a>, <a href="technology">technology</a> (e.g. within anarcho-primitivism), and <a href="Issues%20in%20anarchism%23Participation%20in%20statist%20democracy">the democratic process</a> may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.

On a tactical level, while <a href="propaganda%20of%20the%20deed">propaganda of the deed</a> was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the <a href="Nihilist%20movement">Nihilist movement</a>), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative direct action methods such as <a href="nonviolence">nonviolence</a>, <a href="counter-economics">counter-economics</a> and <a href="Crypto-anarchism">anti-state cryptography</a> to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many <a href="definitional%20concerns%20in%20anarchist%20theory">definitional concerns in anarchist theory</a>.
Topics of interest.
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.

Free love.
An important current within anarchism is free love. Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to Josiah Warren and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's sovereignty. Free love particularly stressed <a href="women%27s%20rights">women's rights</a> since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures. The most important American free love journal was "<a href="Lucifer%20the%20Lightbearer">Lucifer the Lightbearer</a>" (1883–1907) edited by <a href="Moses%20Harman">Moses Harman</a> and <a href="Lois%20Waisbrooker">Lois Waisbrooker</a>, but also there existed <a href="Ezra%20Heywood">Ezra Heywood</a> and Angela Heywood's "<a href="The%20Word%20%28free%20love%29">The Word</a>" (1872–1890, 1892–1893). "<a href="Free%20Society">Free Society</a>" (1895–1897 as "The Firebrand"; 1897–1904 as "Free Society") was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. The publication advocated free love and women's rights, and critiqued "<a href="Comstockery">Comstockery</a>" – censorship of sexual information. Also <a href="M.%20E.%20Lazarus">M. E. Lazarus</a> was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.

In New York City's <a href="Greenwich%20Village">Greenwich Village</a>, <a href="Bohemianism">bohemian</a> feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality, and the openly bisexual radical <a href="Edna%20St.%20Vincent%20Millay">Edna St. Vincent Millay</a> and the lesbian anarchist <a href="Margaret%20Anderson">Margaret Anderson</a> were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by Emma Goldman, among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defence of homosexual love before the general public." In fact, before Goldman, <a href="heterosexual">heterosexual</a> anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based <a href="German%20language">German language</a> journal "Der arme Teufel" (English: The Poor Devil). In Argentina anarcha-feminist <a href="Virginia%20Bolten">Virginia Bolten</a> published the newspaper called "" (English: The Woman's Voice), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.

In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was Emile Armand. He proposed the concept of "la camaraderie amoureuse" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of <a href="polyamory">polyamory</a>. In Germany the <a href="stirner">stirner</a>ists Adolf Brand and John Henry Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male <a href="bisexuality">bisexuality</a> and <a href="homosexuality">homosexuality</a>. <a href="Mujeres%20Libres">Mujeres Libres</a> was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by <a href="Luc%C3%ADa%20S%C3%A1nchez%20Saornil">Lucía Sánchez Saornil</a>, Mercedes Comaposada and <a href="Amparo%20Poch%20y%20Gasc%C3%B3n">Amparo Poch y Gascón</a> and had approximately 30,000 members. The organisation was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for <a href="Feminist%20movement">women's liberation</a> and social revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists. Lucía Sánchez Saornil was a main founder of the Spanish <a href="anarcha-feminist">anarcha-feminist</a> federation Mujeres Libres who was open about her <a href="lesbian">lesbian</a>ism. She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalised and subject to <a href="censorship">censorship</a> and punishment.

More recently, the British <a href="anarcho-pacifist">anarcho-pacifist</a> Alex Comfort gained notoriety during the <a href="sexual%20revolution">sexual revolution</a> for writing the bestseller sex manual "<a href="The%20Joy%20of%20Sex">The Joy of Sex</a>". The issue of free love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-<a href="hedonist">hedonist</a> philosopher <a href="Michel%20Onfray">Michel Onfray</a> in such works as "Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire" (2000) and "L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques" (2002).

Libertarian education and freethought.
 For English anarchist William Godwin education was "the main means by which change would be achieved." Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness. For Godwin education had to have "A respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion," "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives," and "A concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school." In his "<a href="Political%20Justice">Political Justice</a>" he criticises state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government". Early American anarchist Josiah Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established. Max Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called "<a href="The%20False%20Principle%20of%20our%20Education">The False Principle of our Education</a>". In it Stirner names his educational principle "personalist," explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters," by which he means "eternal characters ... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment".

In the United States "freethought was a basically <a href="Anti-Christianity">anti-christian</a>, <a href="anti-clerical">anti-clerical</a> movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to "Liberty" (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of "Freethought" and, for a time, "The Truth Seeker". E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal "<a href="Lucifer%2C%20the%20Light-Bearer">Lucifer, the Light-Bearer</a>"". "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as "Lucifer, the Light-Bearer", "Freethought" and "The Truth Seeker" appeared in "Liberty"... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".

In 1901, Catalan anarchist and free-thinker Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia established "modern" or <a href="Progressive%20education">progressive schools</a> in Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. The schools' stated goal was to "educate the working class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state. Murray Bookchin wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally." La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of "<a href="Modern%20School%20%28United%20States%29">Modern Schools</a>" in the United States, <a href="Cuba">Cuba</a>, South America and London. The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper "<a href="Universit%C3%A0%20popolare%20%28Italian%20newspaper%29">Università popolare</a>", founded in 1901. Russian <a href="christian%20anarchist">christian anarchist</a> Leo Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate. Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police. Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture. He thought that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself ... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary". For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".

A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of <a href="unschooling">unschooling</a> and the <a href="anarchist%20free%20school">free school</a> in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to <a href="A.%20S.%20Neill">A. S. Neill</a> founding what became <a href="Summerhill%20School">Summerhill School</a> in 1921. Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice. However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political class struggle-approach.
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term <a href="deschooling">deschooling</a> was popularised by <a href="Ivan%20Illich">Ivan Illich</a>, who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.

Criticisms.
Criticisms of anarchism include moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or <a href="utopian">utopian</a> by its critics.

Autism

Autism is a <a href="neurodevelopmental%20disorder">neurodevelopmental disorder</a> characterized by impaired <a href="Interpersonal%20relationship">social interaction</a>, <a href="language%20acquisition">verbal</a> and <a href="non-verbal%20communication">non-verbal communication</a>, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their <a href="developmental%20milestones">developmental milestones</a> at a normal pace and then <a href="Regressive%20autism">regress</a>. The <a href="Diagnostic%20and%20Statistical%20Manual%20of%20Mental%20Disorders">diagnostic criteria</a> require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three.
Autism is caused by a combination of <a href="Heritability%20of%20autism">genetic</a> and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including <a href="rubella">rubella</a> and use of <a href="ethanol">alcohol</a> or <a href="cocaine">cocaine</a>. <a href="Controversies%20in%20autism">Controversies</a> surround other proposed environmental <a href="Causes%20of%20autism">causes</a>; for example the <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy">vaccine hypotheses</a>, which have since been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how <a href="nerve%20cell">nerve cell</a>s and their <a href="synapse">synapse</a>s connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the <a href="DSM%20V">DSM V</a>, autism is included within the <a href="autism%20spectrum">autism spectrum</a> (ASDs), as is <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and <a href="PDD-NOS">pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified</a> (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met.
Early speech or <a href="Early%20intensive%20behavioral%20intervention">behavioral interventions</a> can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An <a href="Sociological%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism">autistic culture</a> has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be <a href="Autism%20rights%20movement">accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder</a>.
Globally, autism is estimated to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.

Characteristics.
Autism is a highly variable <a href="neurodevelopmental%20disorder">neurodevelopmental disorder</a> that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without <a href="Remission%20%28medicine%29">remission</a>. People with autism may be severely impaired in some respects but normal, or even superior, in others. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years, and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.

Social development.
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related <a href="autism%20spectrum%20disorder">autism spectrum disorder</a>s (ASD; see <a href="%23Classification">Classification</a>) from other developmental disorders. People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic <a href="Temple%20Grandin">Temple Grandin</a> described her inability to understand the <a href="social%20communication">social communication</a> of <a href="neurotypical">neurotypical</a>s, or people with normal <a href="neural%20development">neural development</a>, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".

Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from <a href="social%20norms">social norms</a>; for example, they have less <a href="eye%20contact">eye contact</a> and <a href="turn-taking">turn-taking</a>, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as pointing at things. Three- to five-year-old children with autism are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form <a href="Attachment%20%28psychology%29">attachments</a> to their primary caregivers. Most children with autism display moderately less <a href="Attachment%20in%20children%23Secure%20attachment">attachment security</a> than neurotypical children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD <a href="Face%20perception%23Face%20perception%20in%20individuals%20with%20autism">perform worse on tests of face and emotion recognition</a> although this may be partly due to a lower ability to define a person's own emotions.

Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.

There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and <a href="tantrum">tantrum</a>s.

Communication.
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of <a href="babbling">babbling</a>, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, children with autism have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Children with autism are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (<a href="echolalia">echolalia</a>) or <a href="Pronoun%20reversal">reverse pronouns</a>. <a href="Joint%20attention">Joint attention</a> seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Children with autism may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.

In a pair of studies, high-functioning children with autism aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.

Repetitive behavior.
Autistic individuals can display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.


No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.

Other symptoms.
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from <a href="splinter%20skill">splinter skill</a>s such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious <a href="Savant%20syndrome">autistic savants</a>. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population. <a href="Sensory%20system">Sensory</a> abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements). An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include <a href="Hypotonia">poor muscle tone</a>, <a href="Apraxia">poor motor planning</a>, and <a href="toe%20walking">toe walking</a>; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.

Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in <a href="malnutrition">malnutrition</a>. Although some children with autism also have <a href="gastrointestinal%20symptom">gastrointestinal symptom</a>s, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that children with autism have more or different gastrointestinal symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between gastrointestinal problems and ASD is unclear.

Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of <a href="stress%20%28psychological%29">stress</a>. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a> in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with <a href="Down%20syndrome">Down syndrome</a>; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.

Causes.
It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the <a href="Heritability%20of%20autism">genetics of autism</a> are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare <a href="mutation">mutation</a>s with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and <a href="epigenetic">epigenetic</a> factors which do not change <a href="DNA">DNA</a> sequencing but are heritable and influence <a href="gene%20expression">gene expression</a>. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.

Studies of twins suggest that <a href="heritability">heritability</a> is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a <a href="Mendelian">Mendelian</a> (single-gene) mutation or to a single <a href="chromosome%20abnormality">chromosome abnormality</a>, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. Most loci individually explain less than 1% of cases of autism. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from spontaneous <a href="structural%20variation">structural variation</a> — such as <a href="Deletion%20%28genetics%29">deletions</a>, <a href="Gene%20duplication">duplications</a> or <a href="Chromosomal%20inversion">inversions</a> in genetic material during <a href="meiosis">meiosis</a>. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.

Several lines of evidence point to <a href="Synapse">synaptic</a> dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with <a href="cell%20adhesion">cell adhesion</a>. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known <a href="teratogen">teratogen</a>s (agents that cause <a href="birth%20defect">birth defect</a>s) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from <a href="Human%20fertilization">conception</a>, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.

Exposure to <a href="air%20pollution">air pollution</a> during pregnancy, especially <a href="heavy%20metal%20%28chemistry%29">heavy metals</a> and particulates, may increase the risk of autism. <a href="Environmental%20factor">Environmental factor</a>s that have been claimed without evidence to contribute to or exacerbate autism include certain foods, <a href="infectious%20disease">infectious disease</a>s, <a href="solvent">solvent</a>s, <a href="diesel%20exhaust">diesel exhaust</a>, <a href="PCBs">PCBs</a>, <a href="phthalates">phthalates</a> and <a href="phenols">phenols</a> used in plastic products, <a href="pesticide">pesticide</a>s, <a href="brominated%20flame%20retardant">brominated flame retardant</a>s, <a href="Ethanol">alcohol</a>, smoking, <a href="illicit%20drug">illicit drug</a>s, <a href="vaccine">vaccine</a>s, and <a href="prenatal%20stress">prenatal stress</a>. No evidence has been found for these claims, and some such as the MMR vaccine have been completely disproven.

Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming <a href="Vaccine%20controversy%23Vaccine%20overload">vaccine "overload"</a>, a <a href="Thiomersal%20controversy">vaccine preservative</a>, or the <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy">MMR vaccine</a> for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of <a href="childhood%20immunizations">childhood immunizations</a>, <a href="MMR%20vaccine%20controversy%23Disease%20outbreaks">outbreaks of previously controlled childhood diseases</a> in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.

Mechanism.
Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the <a href="pathophysiology">pathophysiology</a> of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the <a href="neuropsychological">neuropsychological</a> linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.

Pathophysiology.
Unlike many other brain disorders, such as <a href="Parkinson%27s">Parkinson's</a>, autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms. Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product. <a href="Neuroanatomical">Neuroanatomical</a> studies and the associations with <a href="teratogens">teratogens</a> strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors. Just after birth, the brains of children with autism tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood. It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all children with autism. It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization. Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following:

The <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> is thought to play an important role in autism. Children with autism have been found by researchers to have <a href="inflammation">inflammation</a> of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory <a href="cytokines">cytokines</a> and significant activation of <a href="microglia">microglia</a>. Biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication. Interactions between the <a href="immune%20system">immune system</a> and the <a href="nervous%20system">nervous system</a> begin early during the <a href="Human%20embryogenesis">embryonic stage</a> of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is thought that activation of a pregnant mother's immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development. This is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism.

The relationship of <a href="neurochemical">neurochemical</a>s to autism is not well understood; several have been investigated, with the most evidence for the role of <a href="serotonin">serotonin</a> and of genetic differences in its transport. The role of group I <a href="metabotropic%20glutamate%20receptors">metabotropic glutamate receptors</a> (mGluR) in the pathogenesis of <a href="fragile%20X%20syndrome">fragile X syndrome</a>, the most common identified genetic cause of autism, has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway. Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several <a href="growth%20hormone">growth hormone</a>s or to impaired regulation of <a href="growth%20factor%20receptor">growth factor receptor</a>s. Also, some <a href="inborn%20errors%20of%20metabolism">inborn errors of metabolism</a> are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases.

The <a href="mirror%20neuron%20system">mirror neuron system</a> (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions. Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD. However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of children with autism on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object.
ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks.
In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the <a href="default%20network">default network</a>, a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact connectivity of the <a href="task-positive%20network">task-positive network</a>, used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking. In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of <a href="self-referential">self-referential</a> thought.

The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes. Evidence for this theory has been found in <a href="functional%20neuroimaging">functional neuroimaging</a> studies on autistic individuals and by a <a href="Electroencephalography">brainwave</a> study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the <a href="Cerebral%20cortex">cortex</a> and weak functional connections between the <a href="frontal%20lobe">frontal lobe</a> and the rest of the cortex. Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each <a href="Cerebral%20hemisphere">hemisphere</a> of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the <a href="Association%20areas">association cortex</a>.

From studies based on <a href="event-related%20potential">event-related potential</a>s, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli. For example, <a href="magnetoencephalography">magnetoencephalography</a> studies have found evidence in children with autism of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.

In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a> based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with <a href="1q21.1%20deletion%20syndrome">1q21.1 deletion syndrome</a>. Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 (15q13.3), chromosome 16 (16p13.1) and chromosome 17 (17p12) are inconclusive.

Functional connectivity studies have found both hypo- and hyper-connectivity in brains of people with autism. Hypo-connectivity seems to dominate, especially for interhemispheric and cortico-cortical functional connectivity.

Neuropsychology.
Two major categories of <a href="cognitive">cognitive</a> theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.

The first category focuses on deficits in <a href="social%20cognition">social cognition</a>. <a href="Simon%20Baron-Cohen">Simon Baron-Cohen</a>'s <a href="empathizing%E2%80%93systemizing%20theory">empathizing–systemizing theory</a> postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing. These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier <a href="theory%20of%20mind">theory of mind</a> approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by the atypical responses of children with autism to the <a href="Sally%E2%80%93Anne%20test">Sally–Anne test</a> for reasoning about others' motivations, and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in "<a href="%23Pathophysiology">Pathophysiology</a>" maps well to the hypothesis. However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.

The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the <a href="executive%20functions">executive functions</a> such as <a href="working%20memory">working memory</a>, planning, <a href="Inhibition%20Theory">inhibition</a>. In his review, Kenworthy states that "the claim of <a href="executive%20dysfunction">executive dysfunction</a> as a causal factor in autism is controversial", however, "it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism". Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels. A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young children with autism.

<a href="Weak%20central%20coherence%20theory">Weak central coherence theory</a> hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people. A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and <a href="perceptual">perceptual</a> operations in autistic individuals. These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.

Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties. A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.

Diagnosis.
<a href="Medical%20diagnosis">Diagnosis</a> is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Under the <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a>, autism is characterized by persistent deficits in social communication and interaction across multiple contexts, as well as restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities. These deficits are present in early childhood, typically before age three, and lead to clinically significant functional impairment. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or <a href="Idiosyncrasy%23Psychiatry%20and%20psychology">idiosyncratic language</a>, and persistent preoccupation with unusual objects. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a>, <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> or global developmental delay. <a href="ICD-10">ICD-10</a> uses essentially the same definition.

Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the <a href="Autism%20Diagnostic%20Interview-Revised">Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised</a> (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the <a href="Autism%20Diagnostic%20Observation%20Schedule">Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule</a> (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The <a href="Childhood%20Autism%20Rating%20Scale">Childhood Autism Rating Scale</a> (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children. The Diagnostic interview for social and communication disorders (DISCO) may also be used.

A <a href="pediatrician">pediatrician</a> commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated <a href="medical%20conditions">medical conditions</a>. A pediatric <a href="neuropsychologist">neuropsychologist</a> is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A <a href="differential%20diagnosis">differential diagnosis</a> for ASD at this stage might also consider <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a>, <a href="hearing%20impairment">hearing impairment</a>, and a <a href="specific%20language%20impairment">specific language impairment</a> such as <a href="Landau%E2%80%93Kleffner%20syndrome">Landau–Kleffner syndrome</a>. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as <a href="Major%20depressive%20disorder">depression</a>.

<a href="Clinical%20genetics">Clinical genetics</a> evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and <a href="fragile%20X">fragile X</a> testing. A <a href="Genotype-first%20approach">genotype-first</a> model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics. <a href="Metabolic">Metabolic</a> and <a href="neuroimaging">neuroimaging</a> tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.

ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later. In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.

Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the <a href="visually%20impaired">visually impaired</a>, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or <a href="blindism">blindism</a>s.

Classification.
Autism is one of the five <a href="pervasive%20developmental%20disorder">pervasive developmental disorder</a>s (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.

Of the five PDD forms, <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a> is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; <a href="Rett%20syndrome">Rett syndrome</a> and <a href="childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">childhood disintegrative disorder</a> share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; <a href="PDD%20not%20otherwise%20specified">PDD not otherwise specified</a> (PDD-NOS; also called "atypical autism") is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in <a href="language%20development">language development</a>. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the "autism spectrum disorders" (ASD) or sometimes the "autistic disorders", whereas autism itself is often called "autistic disorder", "childhood autism", or "infantile autism". In this article, "autism" refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, "autism", "ASD", and "PDD" are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like <a href="Trait%20%28biology%29">traits</a>, such as avoiding eye contact.

The manifestations of autism cover a wide <a href="Spectrum%20disorder">spectrum</a>, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, <a href="developmentally%20disabled">developmentally disabled</a>, and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, <a href="pedantic">pedantic</a> communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or <a href="high-functioning%20autism">high-functioning autism</a> (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on <a href="IQ">IQ</a> thresholds, or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into <a href="Syndrome">syndromal</a> and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound <a href="intellectual%20disability">intellectual disability</a> or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as <a href="tuberous%20sclerosis">tuberous sclerosis</a>. Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the <a href="Diagnosis%20of%20Asperger%20syndrome%23Differences%20from%20high-functioning%20autism">overlap between Asperger syndrome, HFA, and non-syndromal autism</a> is unclear.

Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that <a href="regressive%20autism">regressive autism</a> is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.

Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of <a href="psychiatry">psychiatry</a>, <a href="psychology">psychology</a>, <a href="neurology">neurology</a> and <a href="pediatrics">pediatrics</a>. Newer technologies such as <a href="fMRI">fMRI</a> and <a href="diffusion%20tensor%20imaging">diffusion tensor imaging</a> can help identify biologically relevant <a href="phenotype">phenotype</a>s (observable traits) that can be viewed on <a href="brain%20scan">brain scan</a>s, to help further <a href="neurogenetic">neurogenetic</a> studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the <a href="fusiform%20face%20area">fusiform face area</a> of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.

Screening.
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months. According to an article failure to meet any of the following milestones "is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome".

The <a href="United%20States%20Preventive%20Services%20Task%20Force">United States Preventive Services Task Force</a> in 2016 found it was unclear if screening was beneficial or harmful among children in whom there is no concerns. The Japanese practice is to <a href="Screening%20%28medicine%29">screen</a> all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the <a href="Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers</a> (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on <a href="Modified%20Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">M-CHAT</a> and its predecessor, the <a href="Checklist%20for%20Autism%20in%20Toddlers">Checklist for Autism in Toddlers</a> (CHAT), on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low <a href="Sensitivity%20%28tests%29">sensitivity</a> (many false-negatives) but good <a href="Specificity%20%28tests%29">specificity</a> (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although <a href="genetic%20screening">genetic screening</a> for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and <a href="dysmorphic%20feature">dysmorphic feature</a>s.

Prevention.
Infection with <a href="rubella">rubella</a> during <a href="pregnancy">pregnancy</a> causes fewer than 1% of cases of autism; <a href="rubella%20vaccine">vaccination against rubella</a> can prevent many of those cases.

Management.
The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. In general, higher IQs are correlated with greater responsiveness to treatment and improved treatment outcomes. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about <a href="efficacy">efficacy</a>, however the development of evidence-based interventions has advanced in recent years. Although many <a href="psychosocial">psychosocial</a> interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of <a href="systematic%20review">systematic review</a>s of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained <a href="special%20education">special education</a> programs and <a href="behavior%20therapy">behavior therapy</a> early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. Available approaches include <a href="applied%20behavior%20analysis">applied behavior analysis</a> (ABA), developmental models, <a href="TEACCH">structured teaching</a>, <a href="speech%20and%20language%20therapy">speech and language therapy</a>, <a href="social%20skills">social skills</a> therapy, and <a href="occupational%20therapy">occupational therapy</a>. Among these approaches, interventions either treat autistic features comprehensively, or focalize treatment on a specific area of deficit. There is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI), an early intervention model based on ABA for 20 to 40 hours a week for multiple years, is an effective treatment for some children with ASD. Two theoretical frameworks outlined for early childhood intervention include applied behavioral analysis (ABA) and developmental social pragmatic models (DSP). One interventional strategy utilizes a parent training model, which teaches parents how to implement various ABA and DSP techniques, allowing for parents to disseminate interventions themselves. Various DSP programs have been developed to explicitly deliver intervention systems through at-home parent implementation. Despite the recent development of parent training models, these interventions have demonstrated effectiveness in numerous studies, being evaluated as a probable efficacious mode of treatment.

Education.
Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children: <a href="Early%20intensive%20behavioral%20intervention">intensive ABA treatment</a> has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children. Similarly, teacher-implemented intervention that utilizes an ABA combined with a developmental social pragmatic approach has been found to be a well-established treatment in improving social-communication skills in young children, although there is less evidence in its treatment of global symptoms. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.

Medication.
Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed <a href="psychoactive%20drug">psychoactive drug</a>s or <a href="anticonvulsant">anticonvulsant</a>s, with the most common drug classes being <a href="antidepressant">antidepressant</a>s, <a href="stimulant">stimulant</a>s, and <a href="antipsychotic">antipsychotic</a>s. Antipsychotics, such as <a href="risperidone">risperidone</a> and <a href="aripiprazole">aripiprazole</a>, have been found to be useful for treating irritability, repetitive behavior, and sleeplessness that often occurs with autism, however their side effects must be weighed against their potential benefits, and people with autism may respond atypically. There is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. No known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.

Alternative medicine.
Although many <a href="Alternative%20therapies%20for%20developmental%20and%20learning%20disabilities">alternative therapies and interventions</a> are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Treatment approaches have little empirical support in <a href="Quality%20of%20life">quality-of-life</a> contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. A 2008 study found that compared to their peers, autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on <a href="casein-free%20diet">casein-free diet</a>s; in 2005, botched <a href="chelation%20therapy">chelation therapy</a> killed a five-year-old child with autism. There has been early research looking at <a href="Hyperbaric%20medicine">hyperbaric treatment</a>s in children with autism.

Although popularly used as an <a href="complementary%20and%20alternative%20medicine">alternative treatment</a> for people with autism, there is no good evidence that a <a href="gluten-free%20diet">gluten-free diet</a> is of benefit. In the subset of people who have <a href="non-celiac%20gluten%20sensitivity">gluten sensitivity</a> there is limited evidence that suggests that a gluten free diet may improve some autistic behaviors.

Cost.
Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ (<a href="net%20present%20value">net present value</a> in dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% <a href="medical%20care">medical care</a>, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity. Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 US study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that <a href="child%20care">child care</a> problems will greatly affect parental employment. US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance. After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and <a href="estate%20planning">estate planning</a>.

Society and culture.
The emergence of the autism rights movement has served as an attempt to encourage people to be more tolerant of those with autism. Through this movement, people hope to cause others to think of autism as a difference instead of a disease. Proponents of this movement wish to seek "acceptance, not cures." There have also been many worldwide events promoting autism awareness such as <a href="World%20Autism%20Awareness%20Day">World Autism Awareness Day</a>, <a href="Light%20It%20Up%20Blue">Light It Up Blue</a>, <a href="Autism%20Sunday">Autism Sunday</a>, <a href="Autistic%20Pride%20Day">Autistic Pride Day</a>, <a href="Autreat">Autreat</a>, and others. There have also been many organizations dedicated to increasing the awareness of autism and the effects that autism has on someone's life. These organizations include <a href="Autism%20Speaks">Autism Speaks</a>, <a href="Autism%20National%20Committee">Autism National Committee</a>, <a href="Autism%20Society%20of%20America">Autism Society of America</a>, and many others. Social-science scholars have had an increased focused on studying those with autism in hopes to learn more about "autism as a culture, transcultural comparisons... and research on social movements." Media has had an influence on how the public perceives those with autism. "<a href="Rain%20Man">Rain Man</a>", a film that won 4 Oscars including Best Picture, depicts a character with autism who has incredible talents and abilities. While many autistics don't have these special abilities, there are some autistic individuals who have been successful in their fields.

Prognosis.
There is no known cure. Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most children with autism acquire language by age five or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Most children with autism lack <a href="social%20support">social support</a>, meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or <a href="Self-determination%20theory">self-determination</a>. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.

Few high-quality studies address long-term <a href="prognosis">prognosis</a>. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an <a href="IQ">IQ</a> above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; <a href="independent%20living">independent living</a> is unlikely with severe autism. Most people with autism face significant obstacles in transitioning to adulthood.

Epidemiology.
Most recent <a href="review">review</a>s tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD, and 11 per 1,000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true rate. Globally, autism affects an estimated 24.8 million people as of 2015, while Asperger syndrome affects a further 37.2 million. In 2012, the <a href="National%20Health%20Service">NHS</a> estimated that the overall prevalence of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the UK was 1.1%. Rates of <a href="PDD-NOS">PDD-NOS</a>'s has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and <a href="childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">childhood disintegrative disorder</a> at 0.02 per 1,000. CDC's most recent estimate is that 1 out of every 68 children, or 14.7 per 1,000, has an ASD as of 2010.

The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.

Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without. Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed; one theory is that females are underdiagnosed.

Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.

Several other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:

History.
A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The "<a href="Table%20Talk%20%28Luther%29">Table Talk</a>" of <a href="Martin%20Luther">Martin Luther</a>, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance. The <a href="Wild%20Boy%20of%20Aveyron">Wild Boy of Aveyron</a>, a <a href="feral%20child">feral child</a> caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student <a href="Jean%20Marc%20Gaspard%20Itard">Jean Itard</a> treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.

The <a href="New%20Latin">New Latin</a> word "autismus" (English translation "autism") was coined by the <a href="Swiss%20people">Swiss</a> psychiatrist <a href="Eugen%20Bleuler">Eugen Bleuler</a> in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of <a href="schizophrenia">schizophrenia</a>. He derived it from the Greek word "autós" (αὐτός, meaning "self"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".

The word "autism" first took its modern sense in 1938 when <a href="Hans%20Asperger">Hans Asperger</a> of the <a href="Vienna%20General%20Hospital">Vienna University Hospital</a> adopted Bleuler's terminology "autistic psychopaths" in a lecture in German about <a href="child%20psychology">child psychology</a>. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as <a href="Asperger%20syndrome">Asperger syndrome</a>, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. <a href="Leo%20Kanner">Leo Kanner</a> of the <a href="Johns%20Hopkins%20Hospital">Johns Hopkins Hospital</a> first used "autism" in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label "early infantile autism" in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.

<a href="Donald%20Triplett">Donald Triplett</a> was the first person diagnosed with autism. He was diagnosed by <a href="Leo%20Kanner">Leo Kanner</a> after being first examined in 1938, and was labeled as "case 1". Triplett was noted for his savant abilities, particularly being able to name musical notes played on a piano and mentally multiplying numbers. His father, Oliver, described him as socially withdrawn but interested in number patterns, music notes, letters of the alphabet, and U.S. president pictures. By the age of 2, he had the ability to recite the 23rd Psalm and memorized 25 questions and answers from the Presbyterian catechism. He was also interested in creating musical chords.

Kanner's reuse of "autism" led to decades of confused terminology like "infantile schizophrenia", and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "<a href="refrigerator%20mother">refrigerator mother</a>s". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome. As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; while in 2007 it was believed to be one of the most heritable psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have affected how we view ASD, parents continue to feel <a href="social%20stigma">social stigma</a> in situations where their child's autistic behavior is perceived negatively, and many <a href="primary%20care%20physician">primary care physician</a>s and <a href="medical%20specialist">medical specialist</a>s express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.

It took until 1980 for the <a href="DSM-III">DSM-III</a> to differentiate autism from childhood schizophrenia. In 1987, the <a href="DSM-III-R">DSM-III-R</a> provided a checklist for diagnosing autism. In May 2013, the <a href="DSM-5">DSM-5</a> was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including <a href="PDD-NOS">PDD-NOS</a>, Autism, <a href="Asperger%20Syndrome">Asperger Syndrome</a>, <a href="Rett%20Syndrome">Rett Syndrome</a>, and <a href="Childhood%20disintegrative%20disorder">CDD</a>, has been removed and replaced with the general term of Autism Spectrum Disorders. The two categories that exist are impaired social communication and/or interaction and restricted and/or repetitive behaviors.

The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. <a href="Sociological%20and%20cultural%20aspects%20of%20autism">Sociological and cultural aspects of autism</a> have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that <a href="Neurodiversity">autism is simply another way of being</a>.

Albedo

Albedo () is a measure for <a href="reflectance">reflectance</a> or optical brightness (<a href="Latin">Latin</a> "albedo," <a href="Arabic">Arabic</a> "albayad," "whiteness"). It is <a href="Dimensionless%20number">dimensionless</a> and measured on a scale from zero (corresponding to a <a href="black%20body">black body</a> that absorbs all incident radiation) to one (corresponding to a white body that reflects all incident radiation).

Surface albedo is defined as the ratio of radiation reflected to the radiation incident on a surface. The proportion reflected is not only determined by properties of the surface itself, but also by the spectral and angular distribution of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. These factors vary with atmospheric composition, geographic location and time (see <a href="Position%20of%20the%20Sun">Position of the Sun</a>). While bi-hemispherical <a href="reflectance">reflectance</a> is calculated for a single angle of incidence (i.e., for a given position of the sun), albedo is the directional integration of reflectance over all solar angles in a given period. The temporal resolution may range from seconds (as obtained from flux measurements) to daily, seasonal or annual averages.

Unless given for a specific wavelength (spectral albedo), albedo refers to the entire <a href="Sunlight">spectrum of solar radiation</a>. Due to measurement constraints, it is often given for the spectrum in which most solar energy reaches the surface (approximately between 0.3 and 3 μm). This spectrum includes <a href="Visible%20spectrum">visible light</a> (0.39-0.7 μm), which explains why surfaces with a low albedo appear dark (e.g., trees absorb most radiation), whereas surfaces with a high albedo appear bright (e.g., snow reflects most radiation).

Albedo is an important concept in <a href="climatology">climatology</a>, <a href="astronomy">astronomy</a>, and environmental management (e.g., as part of the <a href="Leadership%20in%20Energy%20and%20Environmental%20Design">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) program for sustainable rating of buildings). The average albedo of the Earth at the top of the atmosphere, its "planetary albedo", is 30 to 35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.

The term albedo was introduced into optics by <a href="Johann%20Heinrich%20Lambert">Johann Heinrich Lambert</a> in his 1760 work "<a href="Photometria">Photometria</a>".

Terrestrial albedo.
Any albedo in visible light falls within a range of about 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a <a href="black%20body">black body</a>. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. The average albedo of <a href="Earth">Earth</a> is about 0.3. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.
Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via <a href="Earth%20observation">Earth observation</a> satellite sensors such as <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="MODIS">MODIS</a> instruments on board the <a href="Terra%20%28satellite%29">Terra</a> and <a href="Aqua%20%28satellite%29">Aqua</a> satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a mathematical model is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of <a href="directional-hemispherical%20reflectance">directional-hemispherical reflectance</a> and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.,). These calculations are based on the <a href="Bidirectional%20reflectance%20distribution%20function">bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF)</a>, which describes how the reflectance of a given surface depends on the view angle of the observer and the solar angle. Thereby, the BRDF allows to translate observations of reflectance into albedo.

Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the <a href="greenhouse%20effect">greenhouse effect</a> is currently about 15 °C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective), the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40 °C. If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 °C. In contrast, if the entire Earth was covered by water — a so-called aquaplanet — the average temperature on the planet would rise to almost 27 °C.

White-sky and black-sky albedo.
For land surfaces, it has been shown that the albedo at a particular <a href="solar%20zenith%20angle">solar zenith angle</a> "θ" can be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, formula_1, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, formula_2, with formula_3 being the proportion of direct radiation from a given solar angle, and formula_4 being the proportion of diffuse illumination.

Hence, the actual albedo formula_5 (also called blue-sky albedo) can then be given as:

<a href="Directional-hemispherical%20reflectance">Directional-hemispherical reflectance</a> is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and <a href="bi-hemispherical%20reflectance">bi-hemispherical reflectance</a> as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.

Astronomical albedo.
The albedos of <a href="planet">planet</a>s, <a href="Natural%20satellite">satellites</a> and <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of <a href="photometry%20%28astronomy%29">photometry</a>. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer <a href="Solar%20System">Solar System</a> objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about <a href="regolith">regolith</a> properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in <a href="asteroid">asteroid</a>s.

<a href="Enceladus">Enceladus</a>, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is <a href="Eris%20%28dwarf%20planet%29">Eris</a>, with an albedo of 0.96. Many small objects in the outer Solar System and <a href="asteroid%20belt">asteroid belt</a> have low albedos down to about 0.05. A typical <a href="comet%20nucleus">comet nucleus</a> has an albedo of 0.04. Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily <a href="space%20weathering">space weathered</a> surface containing some <a href="organic%20compound">organic compound</a>s.

The overall albedo of the <a href="Moon">Moon</a> is measured to be around 0.136, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong <a href="opposition%20effect">opposition effect</a>. Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the <a href="regolith">regolith</a> surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.

Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) <a href="geometric%20albedo">geometric albedo</a> (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the <a href="Bond%20albedo">Bond albedo</a> (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.

In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five <a href="Hapke%20parameters">Hapke parameters</a> which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with <a href="phase%20angle%20%28astronomy%29">phase angle</a>, including a characterization of the opposition effect of <a href="regolith">regolith</a> surfaces.

The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, <a href="Absolute%20magnitude%23Absolute%20magnitude%20for%20planets%20%28H%29">absolute magnitude</a> and diameter is:
formula_7,

where formula_8 is the astronomical albedo, formula_9 is the diameter in kilometers, and formula_10 is the absolute magnitude.

Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.
Illumination.
Although the albedo–temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater. The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between three and twelve degrees north. The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.

Insolation effects.
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local <a href="insolation">insolation</a> (solar irradiance); high albedo areas in the <a href="arctic">arctic</a> and <a href="antarctic">antarctic</a> regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the <a href="Sahara%20Desert">Sahara Desert</a>, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. <a href="Tropical">Tropical</a> and <a href="sub-tropical">sub-tropical</a> <a href="rainforest">rainforest</a> areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their <a href="temperate%20forest">temperate forest</a> counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes. 

Climate and weather.
Albedo affects <a href="climate">climate</a> by determining how much <a href="radiation">radiation</a> a planet absorbs. The uneven heating of Earth from albedo variations between land, ice, or ocean surfaces can drive <a href="weather">weather</a>.

Albedo–temperature feedback.
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature <a href="feedback">feedback</a> results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g., a warm <a href="air%20mass">air mass</a>), the raised albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local <a href="weather">weather</a> is dynamic due to the change of <a href="season">season</a>s, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher <a href="insolation">insolation</a>) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.

Snow.
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow. Over <a href="Antarctica">Antarctica</a> they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice–albedo <a href="positive%20feedback">positive feedback</a>). <a href="Cryoconite">Cryoconite</a>, powdery windblown <a href="dust">dust</a> containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.
Hence, small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates, which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.

Small-scale effects.
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.

Solar photovoltaic effects.
Albedo can affect the <a href="electrical%20energy">electrical energy</a> output of solar <a href="photovoltaic%20system">photovoltaic device</a>s. For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar photovoltaic technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%. More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven photovoltaic materials covering three common photovoltaic system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.

Trees.
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and <a href="visible%20spectrum">visible spectrum</a> is absorbed through <a href="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a>), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of <a href="deforestation">deforestation</a>). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect. Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through <a href="evapotranspiration">evapotranspiration</a>. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase albedo when it condenses into clouds Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate 

In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. <a href="Deciduous%20trees">Deciduous trees</a> have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas <a href="coniferous%20trees">coniferous trees</a> have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.

Studies by the <a href="Hadley%20Centre">Hadley Centre</a> have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of <a href="carbon%20sequestration">carbon sequestration</a> on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g., Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.

Water.
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the <a href="Fresnel%20equations">Fresnel equations</a> (see graph).

At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally <a href="specular%20reflection">specular manner</a> (not <a href="Diffuse%20reflection">diffusely</a>). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small <a href="angle%20of%20incidence%20%28optics%29">angles of incident</a> light, <a href="waviness">waviness</a> results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.

Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the <a href="terminator%20%28solar%29">terminator</a> (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.

Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.

Clouds.
<a href="Cloud%20albedo">Cloud albedo</a> has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."

Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the <a href="contrail">contrail</a>s of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 °C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.

Aerosol effects.
<a href="Aerosols">Aerosols</a> (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as <a href="cloud%20condensation%20nuclei">cloud condensation nuclei</a> and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain. As per the effects are:
Black carbon.
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from <a href="black%20carbon">black carbon</a> particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the <a href="Intergovernmental%20Panel%20on%20Climate%20Change">Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</a> estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m. Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.

Human activities.
Human activities (e.g., deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.

Other types of albedo.
<a href="Single-scattering%20albedo">Single-scattering albedo</a> is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material (<a href="refractive%20index">refractive index</a>); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

A

A (<a href="English%20alphabet%23Letter%20names">named</a> , plural "As", "A's", "a"s, "a's" or "aes") is the first <a href="Letter%20%28alphabet%29">letter</a> and the first <a href="vowel">vowel</a> in the <a href="ISO%20basic%20Latin%20alphabet">ISO basic Latin alphabet</a>. It is similar to the <a href="Greek_alphabet%23History">Ancient Greek letter</a> <a href="alpha">alpha</a>, from which it derives. The upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lower-case version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children, and is also found in <a href="italic%20type">italic type</a>.

History.
The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is <a href="aleph">aleph</a> (also written 'aleph), the first letter of the <a href="Phoenician%20alphabet">Phoenician alphabet</a>, which consisted entirely of <a href="consonant">consonant</a>s (for that reason, it is also called an <a href="abjad">abjad</a> to distinguish it from a true <a href="alphabet">alphabet</a>). In turn, the ancestor of aleph may have been a <a href="pictogram">pictogram</a> of an ox head in <a href="proto-Sinaitic%20script">proto-Sinaitic script</a> influenced by <a href="Egyptian%20hieroglyphs">Egyptian hieroglyphs</a>, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.

In 1600 B.C.E., the Phoenician alphabet letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name is thought to have corresponded closely to the <a href="Hebrew%20alphabet">Hebrew</a> or <a href="Arabic%20script">Arabic</a> aleph.
When the <a href="Ancient%20Greece">ancient Greeks</a> adopted the alphabet, they had no use for a letter to represent the <a href="glottal%20stop">glottal stop</a>—the consonant sound that the letter denoted in <a href="Phoenician%20language">Phoenician</a> and other <a href="Semitic%20languages">Semitic languages</a>, and that was the first <a href="phoneme">phoneme</a> of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter—so they used their version of the sign to represent the vowel , and called it by the similar name of <a href="alpha">alpha</a>. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the <a href="Greek%20Dark%20Ages">Greek Dark Ages</a>, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the <a href="Greek%20alphabet">Greek alphabet</a> of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.

The <a href="Etruscan%20civilization">Etruscans</a> brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the <a href="Italian%20Peninsula">Italian Peninsula</a> and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the <a href="Old%20Italic%20script">Etruscan alphabet</a> to write the <a href="Latin">Latin language</a>, and the resulting letter was preserved in the <a href="Latin%20script">Latin alphabet</a> that would come to be used to write many languages, including English.

Typographic variants.
During Roman times, there were many variant forms of the letter "A". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" mediums. There was also a <a href="cursive">cursive</a> style used for everyday or utilitarian writing, which was done on more perishable surfaces. Due to the "perishable" nature of these surfaces, there are not as many examples of this style as there are of the monumental, but there are still many surviving examples of different types of cursive, such as <a href="letter%20case">majuscule</a> cursive, <a href="letter%20case">minuscule</a> cursive, and semicursive minuscule. Variants also existed that were intermediate between the monumental and cursive styles. The known variants include the early <a href="Uncial%20script%23Half-uncial">semi-uncial</a>, the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.

At the end of the <a href="Roman%20Empire">Roman Empire</a> (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule developed through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of <a href="Italy">Italy</a>, the <a href="Merovingian%20script">Merovingian script</a> in France, the <a href="Visigothic%20script">Visigothic script</a> in Spain, and the <a href="Insular%20script">Insular</a> or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the <a href="Carolingian%20minuscule">Caroline script</a>, which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.

15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two main variants that are known today. These variants, the "Italic" and "Roman" forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italic form, also called "script a," is used in most current <a href="handwriting">handwriting</a> and consists of a circle and vertical stroke. This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter <a href="tau">tau</a> in the hands of medieval Irish and English writers. The Roman form is used in most printed material; it consists of a small loop with an arc over it ("a"). Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the <a href="serif">serif</a> that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.

<a href="Italic%20type">Italic type</a> is commonly used to mark emphasis or more generally to distinguish one part of a text from the rest (set in Roman type). There are some other cases aside from italic type where "script a" ("ɑ"), also called <a href="Latin%20alpha">Latin alpha</a>, is used in contrast with Latin "a" (such as in the <a href="International%20Phonetic%20Alphabet">International Phonetic Alphabet</a>).

Use in writing systems.
English.
In modern <a href="English%20orthography">English orthography</a>, the letter represents at least seven different vowel sounds:

The double sequence does not occur in native English words, but is found in some words derived from foreign languages such as "Aaron" and "<a href="aardvark">aardvark</a>". However, occurs in <a href="List%20of%20Latin-script%20digraphs">many common digraphs</a>, all with their own sound or sounds, particularly , , , , and .

Other languages.
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, denotes an open unrounded vowel, such as , , or . An exception is <a href="Saanich%20dialect">Saanich</a>, in which (and the glyph <a href="%C3%81">Á</a>) stands for a <a href="close-mid%20front%20unrounded%20vowel">close-mid front unrounded vowel</a> .

Other systems.
In phonetic and phonemic notation:

Other uses.
In <a href="algebra">algebra</a>, the letter "A" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (x,y,z) are used to denote unknown quantities.

In <a href="geometry">geometry</a>, capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote <a href="Line%20segment">segment</a>s, <a href="line%20%28geometry%29">line</a>s, <a href="Line%20%28geometry%29%23Ray">rays</a>, etc. A capital A is also typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a <a href="triangle">triangle</a>, the lowercase a representing the side opposite angle A.

"A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; <a href="A-list">A-list</a> celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a <a href="motivation">motivating</a> effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.

Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe, or a small cup size in a <a href="brassiere">brassiere</a>.

Alabama

Alabama () is a <a href="U.S.%20state">state</a> in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">southeastern region</a> of the <a href="United%20States">United States</a>. It is bordered by <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> to the north, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> to the east, <a href="Florida">Florida</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> to the south, and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> to the west. Alabama is the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20area">30th-most extensive</a> and the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states%20and%20territories%20by%20population">24th-most populous</a> of the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20states">U.S. states</a>. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways.

Alabama is nicknamed the "<a href="northern%20flicker">Yellowhammer</a> State", after the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20birds">state bird</a>. Alabama is also known as the "Heart of <a href="Dixie">Dixie</a>" and the "<a href="Cotton">Cotton</a> State". The <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20trees">state tree</a> is the <a href="longleaf%20pine">longleaf pine</a>, and the <a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20flowers">state flower</a> is the <a href="camellia">camellia</a>. Alabama's capital is <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>. The largest city by population is <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham</a>, which has long been the most industrialized city; the largest city by land area is <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville</a>. The oldest city is <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a>, founded by French <a href="colonists">colonists</a> in 1702 as the capital of French Louisiana.

From the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a> until <a href="World%20War%20II">World War II</a>, Alabama, like many states in the <a href="Southern%20United%20States">southern U.S.</a>, suffered economic hardship, in part because of its continued dependence on agriculture. Like other southern states, Alabama legislators <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disenfranchised African Americans</a> and many poor whites at the turn of the century. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, <a href="White%20American">white</a> rural interests dominated the state legislature from 1901 to the 1960s; urban interests and <a href="African%20Americans">African Americans</a> were markedly under-represented. Following World War II, Alabama grew as the state's economy changed from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The state economy in the 21st century is based on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.

Etymology.
The European-American naming of the <a href="Alabama%20River">Alabama River</a> and state was derived from the <a href="Alabama%20people">Alabama people</a>, a <a href="Muskogean%20languages">Muskogean-speaking tribe</a> whose members lived just below the confluence of the <a href="Coosa%20River">Coosa</a> and <a href="Tallapoosa%20River">Tallapoosa</a> rivers on the upper reaches of the river. In the <a href="Alabama%20language">Alabama language</a>, the word for a person of Alabama lineage is "Albaamo" (or variously "Albaama" or "Albàamo" in different dialects; the plural form is "Albaamaha").

The word "Alabama" is believed to have come from the <a href="Alabama%20language">Alabama language</a>, and a suggestion the name was borrowed from the <a href="Choctaw%20language">Choctaw language</a> is unlikely. The word's spelling varies significantly among historical sources. The first usage appears in three accounts of the <a href="Hernando%20de%20Soto">Hernando de Soto</a> expedition of 1540: <a href="Garcilaso%20de%20la%20Vega%20%28chronicler%29">Garcilaso de la Vega</a> used "Alibamo", while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote "Alibamu" and "Limamu", respectively, in <a href="transliteration">transliteration</a>s of the term. As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the "Alibamon", with French maps identifying the river as "Rivière des Alibamons". Other spellings of the name have included "Alibamu", "Alabamo", "Albama", "Alebamon", "Alibama", "Alibamou", "Alabamu", "Allibamou".

Sources disagree on the word's meaning. Some scholars suggest the word comes from the Choctaw "alba" (meaning "plants" or "weeds") and "amo" (meaning "to cut", "to trim", or "to gather"). The meaning may have been "clearers of the thicket" or "herb gatherers", referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants. The state has numerous <a href="List%20of%20place%20names%20in%20Alabama%20of%20Native%20American%20origin">place names of Native American origin</a>. However, there are no correspondingly similar words in the Alabama language.

An 1842 article in the "Jacksonville Republican" proposed it meant "Here We Rest." This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of <a href="Alexander%20Beaufort%20Meek">Alexander Beaufort Meek</a>. Experts in the <a href="Muskogean%20languages">Muskogean languages</a> have not found any evidence to support such a translation.

History.
Pre-European settlement.
<a href="Indigenous%20peoples">Indigenous peoples</a> of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before the advent of European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes by the <a href="Ohio%20River">Ohio River</a> began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BC–AD 700) and continued until <a href="European%20colonization%20of%20the%20Americas">European contact</a>.

The agrarian <a href="Mississippian%20culture">Mississippian culture</a> covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the <a href="Moundville%20Archaeological%20Site">Moundville Archaeological Site</a> in <a href="Moundville%2C%20Alabama">Moundville, Alabama</a>. This is the second-largest complex of the classic Middle Mississippian era, after <a href="Cahokia">Cahokia</a> in present-day <a href="Illinois">Illinois</a>, which was the center of the culture. Analysis of <a href="Artifact%20%28archaeology%29">artifacts</a> from <a href="archaeological">archaeological</a> excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the <a href="Southeastern%20Ceremonial%20Complex">Southeastern Ceremonial Complex</a> (SECC). Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to <a href="Mesoamerica">Mesoamerica</a>n culture, but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.

Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the <a href="Cherokee">Cherokee</a>, an <a href="Iroquoian%20language">Iroquoian language</a> people; and the <a href="Muskogean">Muskogean</a>-speaking <a href="Alabama%20%28people%29">Alabama</a> ("Alibamu"), <a href="Chickasaw">Chickasaw</a>, <a href="Choctaw">Choctaw</a>, <a href="Creek%20people">Creek</a>, and <a href="Koasati">Koasati</a>. While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.

European settlement.
With exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama. The expedition of <a href="Hernando%20de%20Soto">Hernando de Soto</a> passed through <a href="Mabila">Mabila</a> and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the region's first European settlement at <a href="Old%20Mobile%20Site">Old Mobile</a> in 1702. The city was moved to the current site of <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a> in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of <a href="La%20Louisiane">La Louisiane</a>.

After the French lost to the British in the <a href="Seven%20Years%27%20War">Seven Years' War</a>, it became part of British <a href="West%20Florida">West Florida</a> from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the <a href="American%20Revolutionary%20War">American Revolutionary War</a>, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.

Thomas Bassett, a <a href="Loyalist%20%28American%20Revolution%29">loyalist</a> to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest white settlers in the state outside Mobile. He settled in the <a href="Tombigbee%20District">Tombigbee District</a> during the early 1770s. The district's boundaries were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the <a href="Tombigbee%20River">Tombigbee River</a> and included portions of what is today southern <a href="Clarke%20County%2C%20Alabama">Clarke County</a>, northernmost <a href="Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama">Mobile County</a>, and most of <a href="Washington%20County%2C%20Alabama">Washington County</a>.

What is now the counties of <a href="Baldwin%20County%2C%20Alabama">Baldwin</a> and <a href="Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a> became part of <a href="Spanish%20West%20Florida">Spanish West Florida</a> in 1783, part of the independent <a href="Republic%20of%20West%20Florida">Republic of West Florida</a> in 1810, and was finally added to the <a href="Mississippi%20Territory">Mississippi Territory</a> in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the <a href="Yazoo%20lands">Yazoo lands</a> beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the <a href="Province%20of%20Georgia">Province of Georgia</a> from 1767 onwards. Following the <a href="American%20Revolution">Revolutionary War</a>, it remained a part of <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a>, although heavily disputed.

With the exception of the area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the <a href="Yazoo%20land%20scandal">Yazoo land scandal</a>. Spain kept a claim on its former Spanish West Florida territory in what would become the coastal counties until the <a href="Adams%E2%80%93On%C3%ADs%20Treaty">Adams–Onís Treaty</a> officially ceded it to the United States in 1819.

19th century.
Before <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi's</a> admission to statehood on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the <a href="Alabama%20Territory">Alabama Territory</a>. The <a href="United%20States%20Congress">United States Congress</a> created the Alabama Territory on March 3, 1817. <a href="St.%20Stephens%2C%20Alabama">St. Stephens</a>, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.

Alabama was admitted as the 22nd state on December 14, 1819 with Congress selecting Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention. From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as temporary capital from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of government moved to <a href="Cahaba%2C%20Alabama">Cahaba</a> in <a href="Dallas%20County%2C%20Alabama">Dallas County</a>.

Cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825. <a href="Alabama%20Fever">Alabama Fever</a> was underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation. Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for white men.

Southeastern planters and traders from the <a href="Upper%20South">Upper South</a> brought <a href="History%20of%20slavery%20in%20Alabama">slaves</a> with them as the cotton <a href="List%20of%20plantations%20in%20Alabama">plantations in Alabama</a> expanded. The economy of the central <a href="Black%20Belt%20%28region%20of%20Alabama%29">Black Belt</a> (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton <a href="Plantation%20complexes%20in%20the%20Southeastern%20United%20States">plantations</a> whose owners' wealth grew largely from slave labor. The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became <a href="subsistence%20farmers">subsistence farmers</a>. Alabama had an estimated population of under 10,000 people in 1810, but it increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830. Most Native American tribes were <a href="Indian%20removal">completely removed</a> from the state within a few years of the passage of the <a href="Indian%20Removal%20Act">Indian Removal Act</a> by Congress in 1830.
From 1826 to 1846, <a href="Tuscaloosa%2C%20Alabama">Tuscaloosa</a> served as Alabama's capital. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. A new capitol building was erected under the direction of <a href="Stephen%20Decatur%20Button">Stephen Decatur Button</a> of <a href="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>. The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day. It was designed by Barachias Holt of <a href="Exeter%2C%20Maine">Exeter, Maine</a>.

By 1860, the population had increased to 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080, were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were <a href="free%20people%20of%20color">free people of color</a>. On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its <a href="Secession%20in%20the%20United%20States">secession</a> from the <a href="Union%20%28American%20Civil%20War%29">Union</a>. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>. The Confederacy's capital was initially at <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>. Alabama was heavily <a href="Alabama%20in%20the%20American%20Civil%20War">involved in the American Civil War</a>. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.
A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama joined <a href="Nathan%20Bedford%20Forrest">Nathan Bedford Forrest</a>'s battalion in <a href="Hopkinsville%2C%20Kentucky">Hopkinsville, Kentucky</a>. The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails. This led to them being greeted with "Yellowhammer", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.

Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865. Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868. From 1867 to 1874, with most white citizens barred temporarily from voting and freedmen enfranchised, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: <a href="Jeremiah%20Haralson">Jeremiah Haralson</a>, <a href="Benjamin%20S.%20Turner">Benjamin S. Turner</a>, and <a href="James%20T.%20Rapier">James T. Rapier</a>.

Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a>, state legislators ratified a <a href="Constitution%20of%20Alabama">new state constitution</a> in 1868 that created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation. Organized <a href="insurgent">insurgent</a>, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original <a href="Ku%20Klux%20Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>, these included the Pale Faces, <a href="Knights%20of%20the%20White%20Camellia">Knights of the White Camellia</a>, <a href="Red%20Shirts%20%28Southern%20United%20States%29">Red Shirts</a>, and the <a href="White%20League">White League</a>.

Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office through an election dominated by fraud and violence. They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the <a href="Blaine%20Amendment">Blaine Amendment</a>, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools. The same year, legislation was approved that called for <a href="racial%20segregation">racially segregated</a> schools. Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891. After disfranchising most African Americans and many poor whites in the 1901 constitution, the Alabama legislature passed more <a href="Jim%20Crow%20laws">Jim Crow laws</a> at the beginning of the 20th century to impose segregation in everyday life.

20th century.
The new 1901 <a href="Constitution%20of%20Alabama">Constitution of Alabama</a> included provisions for voter registration that effectively <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disenfranchised</a> large portions of the population, including nearly all African Americans and Native Americans, and tens of thousands of poor whites, through making voter registration difficult, requiring a <a href="Poll%20tax%20%28United%20States%29">poll tax</a> and <a href="literacy%20test">literacy test</a>. The 1901 constitution required racial segregation of public schools. By 1903, only 2,980 African Americans were registered in Alabama, although at least 74,000 were <a href="literate">literate</a>. This compared to more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote in 1900. The numbers dropped even more in later decades. The state legislature passed additional racial segregation laws related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.

While the planter class had persuaded poor whites to vote for this legislative effort to suppress black voting, the new restrictions resulted in their disenfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative poll tax. By 1941, whites constituted a slight majority of those disenfranchised by these laws: 600,000 whites vs. 520,000 African-Americans. Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote. Despite numerous legal challenges that succeeded in overturning certain provisions, the state legislature would create new ones to maintain disenfranchisement. The exclusion of blacks from the political system persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.

The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disenfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes. Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the <a href="Rosenwald%20Fund">Rosenwald Fund</a> began funding the construction of what came to be known as <a href="Rosenwald%20School">Rosenwald School</a>s. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The fund required the local community and state to raise matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas. They often donated land and labor as well.
Beginning in 1913, the first 80 Rosenwald Schools were built in Alabama for African-American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teachers' houses, and several vocational buildings were completed by 1937 in the state. Several of the <a href="The%20Rosenwald%20School%20Building%20Fund%20and%20Associated%20Buildings%20Multiple%20Property%20Submission">surviving school buildings</a> in the state are now listed on the <a href="National%20Register%20of%20Historic%20Places">National Register of Historic Places</a>.

Continued racial discrimination and <a href="lynching">lynching</a>s, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to <a href="boll%20weevil">boll weevil</a> infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans from rural Alabama and other states to seek opportunities in northern and midwestern cities during the early decades of the 20th century as part of the <a href="Great%20Migration%20%28African%20American%29">Great Migration</a> out of the South. Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see "historical populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.

At the same time, many rural people, both white and African American, migrated to the city of <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham</a> to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called the "Magic City". By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th-largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the state's population. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict after each decennial census according to population changes, as it was required by the state constitution. This did not change until the late 1960s following a lawsuit and court order.

Beginning in the 1940s, when the courts started taking the first steps to recognize the voting rights of black voters, the Alabama legislature took several counter -steps designed to disfranchise black voters. The legislature passed, and the voters ratified [as these were mostly white voters], a state constitutional amendment that gave local registrars greater latitude to disqualify voter registration applicants. Black citizens in <a href="Mobile%2C%20Alabama">Mobile</a> successfully challenged this amendment as a violation of the <a href="Fifteenth%20Amendment%20to%20the%20United%20States%20Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a>. The legislature also changed the boundaries of <a href="Tuskegee%2C%20Alabama">Tuskegee</a> to a 28-sided figure designed to fence out blacks from the city limits. The Supreme Court unanimously held that this racial "<a href="gerrymandering">gerrymandering</a>" violated the Constitution. In 1961, ... the Alabama legislature also intentionally diluted the effect of the black vote by instituting numbered place requirements for local elections.

Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the civil war. Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers occurred in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war-related industries. Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.

Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population, as required by the state constitution to follow the results of decennial censuses. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.

One result was that <a href="Jefferson%20County%2C%20Alabama">Jefferson County</a>, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."

A class action suit initiated on behalf of plaintiffs in <a href="Lowndes%20County%2C%20Alabama">Lowndes County, Alabama</a> challenged the state legislature's lack of redistricting for congressional seats. In 1962 "<a href="White%20v.%20Crook">White v. Crook</a>", Judge <a href="Frank%20M.%20Johnson">Frank M. Johnson</a> ordered the state to redistrict. United States Supreme Court cases of "<a href="Baker%20v.%20Carr">Baker v. Carr</a>" (1962) and "<a href="Reynolds%20v.%20Sims">Reynolds v. Sims</a>" (1964) ruled that the principle of "<a href="one%20man%2C%20one%20vote">one man, one vote</a>" needed to be the basis of both houses of state legislatures as well, and that their districts had to be based on population, rather than geographic counties, as Alabama had used for its senate.

In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature completed the first congressional redistricting based on the decennial census. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years. Other changes were made to implement representative state house and senate districts.

African Americans continued to press in the 1950s and 1960s to end disenfranchisement and segregation in the state through the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, including legal challenges. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in "<a href="Brown%20v.%20Board%20of%20Education">Brown v. Board of Education</a>" that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. During the 1960s, under Governor <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a>, Alabama resisted compliance with federal demands for <a href="desegregation">desegregation</a>. The Civil Rights Movement had notable events in Alabama, including the <a href="Montgomery%20Bus%20Boycott">Montgomery Bus Boycott</a> (1955–56), <a href="Freedom%20Rides">Freedom Rides</a> in 1961, and 1965 <a href="Selma%20to%20Montgomery%20marches">Selma to Montgomery marches</a>. These contributed to Congressional passage and enactment of the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and <a href="Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> by the U.S. Congress.

Legal segregation ended in the states in 1964, but <a href="Jim%20Crow">Jim Crow</a> customs often continued until specifically challenged in court.

Despite recommendations of a 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission, the state legislature did not approve an amendment to establish home rule for counties. There is very limited home rule, but the legislature is deeply involved in passing legislation that applies to county-level functions and policies. This both deprives local residents of the ability to govern themselves and distracts the legislature from statewide issues.
Alabama has made some changes since the late 20th century and has used new types of voting to increase representation. In the 1980s, an omnibus redistricting case, "<a href="Dillard%20v.%20Crenshaw%20County">Dillard v. Crenshaw County</a>", challenged the <a href="at-large">at-large</a> voting for representative seats of 180 Alabama jurisdictions, including counties and school boards. At-large voting had diluted the votes of any minority in a county, as the majority tended to take all seats. Despite African Americans making up a significant minority in the state, they had been unable to elect any representatives in most of the at-large jurisdictions.

As part of settlement of this case, five Alabama cites and counties, including <a href="Chilton%20County%2C%20Alabama">Chilton County</a>, adopted a system of <a href="proportional%20representation">cumulative voting</a> for election of representatives in multi-seat jurisdictions. This has resulted in more proportional representation for voters. In another form of proportional representation, 23 jurisdictions use limited voting, as in <a href="Conecuh%20County%2C%20Alabama">Conecuh County</a>. In 1982, limited voting was first tested in <a href="Conecuh%20County%2C%20Alabama">Conecuh County</a>. Together use of these systems has increased the number of African Americans and women being elected to local offices, resulting in governments that are more representative of their citizens.

Geography.
Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the U.S. About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the <a href="Mississippi%20River">Mississippi River</a> and the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a>. The <a href="North%20Alabama">North Alabama</a> region is mostly mountainous, with the <a href="Tennessee%20River">Tennessee River</a> cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.

Alabama is bordered by the states of <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> to the north, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> to the east, <a href="Florida">Florida</a> to the south, and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> to the west. Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state. The state ranges in elevation from sea level at <a href="Mobile%20Bay">Mobile Bay</a> to over 1,800 feet (550 m) in the <a href="Appalachian%20Mountains">Appalachian Mountains</a> in the northeast.

The highest point is <a href="Mount%20Cheaha">Mount Cheaha</a>, at a height of . Alabama's land consists of of forest or 67% of total land area. Suburban <a href="Baldwin%20County%2C%20Alabama">Baldwin County</a>, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.

A notable natural wonder in Alabama is <a href="Natural%20Bridge%2C%20Alabama">"Natural Bridge"</a> rock, the longest <a href="natural%20bridge">natural bridge</a> east of the <a href="Rocky%20Mountains">Rockies</a>, located just south of <a href="Haleyville%2C%20Alabama">Haleyville</a>.

A -wide meteorite impact crater is located in <a href="Elmore%20County%2C%20Alabama">Elmore County</a>, just north of Montgomery. This is the <a href="Wetumpka%20crater">Wetumpka crater</a>, the site of "Alabama's greatest natural disaster." A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago. The hills just east of downtown <a href="Wetumpka">Wetumpka</a> showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme ("star-wound") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface. In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.

Climate.
The state is classified as <a href="humid%20subtropical%20climate">humid subtropical</a> ("Cfa") under the <a href="Humid%20temperate%20climate">Koppen Climate Classification</a>. The average annual temperature is 64 °F (18 °C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler. Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.

Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to <a href="tropical%20storm">tropical storm</a>s and even <a href="hurricane">hurricane</a>s. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.

South Alabama reports many <a href="thunderstorms">thunderstorms</a>. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent <a href="lightning">lightning</a> and large <a href="hail">hail</a>; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.
Alabama, along with <a href="Oklahoma">Oklahoma</a>, has the most reported <a href="Enhanced%20Fujita%20scale">EF5 tornadoes</a> of any state, according to statistics from the <a href="National%20Climatic%20Data%20Center">National Climatic Data Center</a> for the period January 1, 1950, to June 2013. Several long-tracked F5/EF5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state. The state was affected by the <a href="1974%20Super%20Outbreak">1974 Super Outbreak</a> and was devastated tremendously by the <a href="2011%20Super%20Outbreak">2011 Super Outbreak</a>. The 2011 Super Outbreak produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.
The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state—along the Tennessee Valley—is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as <a href="Dixie%20Alley">Dixie Alley</a>, as distinct from the <a href="Tornado%20Alley">Tornado Alley</a> of the Southern Plains.

Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the southeastern U.S., with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include <a href="New%20Year%27s%20Eve%201963%20snowstorm">New Year's Eve 1963 snowstorm</a> and the <a href="1993%20Storm%20of%20the%20Century">1993 Storm of the Century</a>. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.

Alabama's highest temperature of was recorded on September 5, 1925, in the unincorporated community of <a href="Centerville%2C%20Alabama">Centerville</a>. The record low of occurred on January 30, 1966, in <a href="New%20Market%2C%20Alabama">New Market</a>.

Flora and fauna.
Alabama is home to a diverse array of <a href="flora">flora</a> and <a href="fauna">fauna</a>, due largely to a variety of habitats that range from the <a href="Tennessee%20Valley">Tennessee Valley</a>, <a href="Appalachian%20Plateau">Appalachian Plateau</a>, and <a href="Ridge-and-Valley%20Appalachians">Ridge-and-Valley Appalachians</a> of the north to the <a href="Piedmont%20%28United%20States%29">Piedmont</a>, <a href="Canebrake%20%28region%20of%20Alabama%29">Canebrake</a> and <a href="Black%20Belt%20%28region%20of%20Alabama%29">Black Belt</a> of the central region to the <a href="Gulf%20Coastal%20Plain">Gulf Coastal Plain</a> and beaches along the <a href="Gulf%20of%20Mexico">Gulf of Mexico</a> in the south. The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall <a href="biodiversity">biodiversity</a>.

Alabama is in the subtropical coniferous forest biome and once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state. It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora. It is home to nearly 4,000 <a href="pteridophyte">pteridophyte</a> and <a href="spermatophyte">spermatophyte</a> plant species.

<a href="Indigenous%20%28ecology%29">Indigenous</a> animal species in the state include 62 <a href="mammal">mammal</a> <a href="species">species</a>, 93 reptile species, 73 <a href="amphibian">amphibian</a> species, roughly 307 native <a href="freshwater%20fish">freshwater fish</a> species, and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state. Invertebrates include 83 <a href="crayfish">crayfish</a> species and 383 <a href="mollusk">mollusk</a> species. 113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state.

Demographics.
The <a href="United%20States%20Census%20Bureau">United States Census Bureau</a> estimates that the population of Alabama was 4,858,979 on July 1, 2015, which represents an increase of 79,243, or 1.66%, since the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 Census</a>. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 people (that is 502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 people into the state.

<a href="Immigration%20to%20the%20United%20States">Immigration</a> from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people. The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were undocumented (24,000).

The <a href="center%20of%20population">center of population</a> of Alabama is located in <a href="Chilton%20County%2C%20Alabama">Chilton County</a>, outside the town of <a href="Jemison%2C%20Alabama">Jemison</a>.

Race and ancestry.
According to the <a href="2010%20United%20States%20Census">2010 Census</a>, Alabama had a population of 4,779,736. The racial composition of the state was 68.5% <a href="White%20American">White</a> (67.0% <a href="Non-Hispanic%20White">Non-Hispanic White</a> and 1.5% <a href="Hispanic%20White">Hispanic White</a>), 26.2% <a href="African%20American">Black or African American</a>, 3.9% <a href="Hispanic%20and%20Latino%20Americans">Hispanic or Latino</a> of any race, 1.1% Asian, 0.6% <a href="Native%20Americans%20in%20the%20United%20States">American Indian and Alaska Native</a>, 0.1% <a href="Native%20Hawaiians">Native Hawaiian</a> and Other <a href="Pacific%20Islander">Pacific Islander</a>, 2.0% from Some Other Race, and 1.5% from Two or More Races. In 2011, 46.6% of Alabama's population younger than age 1 were minorities.

The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are: <a href="African%20American">African</a> (26.2%), <a href="English%20American">English</a> (23.6%), <a href="Irish%20American">Irish</a> (7.7%), <a href="German%20Americans">German</a> (5.7%), and <a href="Scots-Irish%20American">Scots-Irish</a> (2.0%). Those citing "American" ancestry in Alabama are generally of English or British ancestry; many <a href="English%20American">Anglo-Americans</a> identify as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in some cases since the 1600s. Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and that the figure is likely higher. In the 1980 census, 41% of the people in Alabama identified as being of English ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time.

Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported. Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization. The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.

In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the <a href="Alabama%20Indian%20Affairs%20Commission">Alabama Indian Affairs Commission</a>. Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black.

The state has <a href="State%20recognized%20tribes%20in%20the%20United%20States">officially recognized</a> nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the <a href="Five%20Civilized%20Tribes">Five Civilized Tribes</a> of the American Southeast. These are:

The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.

Language.
95.1% of all Alabama residents five years old or older spoke only English at home in 2010, a minor decrease from 96.1% in 2000. Alabama English is predominantly <a href="Southern%20American%20English">Southern</a>, and is related to South Midland speech which was taken across the border from <a href="Tennessee">Tennessee</a>. In the major Southern speech region, there is the decreasing loss of the final /r/, for example the /boyd/ pronunciation of 'bird.' In the northern third of the state, there is a South Midland 'arm' and 'barb' rhyming with 'form' and 'orb.' Unique words in Alabama English include: redworm (earthworm), peckerwood (woodpecker), snake doctor and snake feeder (dragonfly), tow sack (burlap bag), plum peach (clingstone), French harp (harmonica), and dog irons (andirons).

Religion.
In the 2008 <a href="American%20Religious%20Identification%20Survey">American Religious Identification Survey</a>, 86% of Alabama respondents reported their religion as Christian, including 6% Catholic, and 11% as having no religion. The composition of other traditions is 0.5% Mormon, 0.5% Jewish, 0.5% Muslim, 0.5% Buddhist, and 0.5% Hindu.

Christianity.
Alabama is located in the middle of the <a href="Bible%20Belt">Bible Belt</a>, a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the United States, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly. A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. , the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a>, <a href="The%20United%20Methodist%20Church">The United Methodist Church</a>, and <a href="Nondenominational%20Christianity">non-denominational</a> Evangelical Protestant.

In Alabama, the <a href="Southern%20Baptist%20Convention">Southern Baptist Convention</a> has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the <a href="United%20Methodist%20Church">United Methodist Church</a> with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the <a href="Great%20Awakening">Great Awakening</a> of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The <a href="Assemblies%20of%20God">Assemblies of God</a> had almost 60,000 members, the <a href="Churches%20of%20Christ">Churches of Christ</a> had nearly 120,000 members. The <a href="Presbyterian%20church">Presbyterian church</a>es, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (<a href="Presbyterian%20Church%20in%20America">PCA</a> – 28,009 members in 108 congregations, <a href="PC%28USA%29">PC(USA)</a> – 26,247 members in 147 congregations, the <a href="Cumberland%20Presbyterian%20Church">Cumberland Presbyterian Church</a> – 6,000 members in 59 congregations, the <a href="Cumberland%20Presbyterian%20Church%20in%20America">Cumberland Presbyterian Church in America</a> – 5,000 members and 50 congregations plus the <a href="Edgewater%20Presbyterian%20Church">EPC</a> and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and 9 congregations).

In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian <a href="Canonical%20Gospels">Gospels</a>. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a "full understanding" of their faith and needed no further learning. In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.

Other faiths.
Although in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including <a href="Judaism">Judaism</a>, <a href="Islam">Islam</a>, <a href="Hinduism">Hinduism</a>, <a href="Buddhism">Buddhism</a>, <a href="Sikhism">Sikhism</a>, the <a href="Bah%C3%A1%27%C3%AD%20Faith">Bahá'í Faith</a>, and <a href="Unitarian%20Universalism">Unitarian Universalism</a>.

Jews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when <a href="Sephardic%20Jews">Sephardic Jews</a> immigrated from London. The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is <a href="Congregation%20Sha%27arai%20Shomayim%20%28Mobile%2C%20Alabama%29">Congregation Sha'arai Shomayim</a> in Mobile. It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844. Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be <a href="Ashkenazi%20Jews">Ashkenazi Jews</a> from eastern Europe. Jewish denominations in the state include two <a href="Orthodox%20Judaism">Orthodox</a>, four <a href="Conservative%20Judaism">Conservative</a>, ten <a href="Reform%20Judaism">Reform</a>, and one <a href="Humanistic%20Judaism">Humanistic</a> synagogue.

Muslims have been increasing in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, many by African-American converts.

Several Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by <a href="Indian%20people">Indian</a> immigrants and their descendants, the best-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham</a>, the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in <a href="Pelham%2C%20Alabama">Pelham</a>, the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in <a href="Capshaw%2C%20Alabama">Capshaw</a>, and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in <a href="Tuscaloosa%2C%20Alabama">Tuscaloosa</a>.

There are six <a href="Dharma%20centre">Dharma centers</a> and organizations for <a href="Theravada">Theravada</a> <a href="Buddhists">Buddhists</a>. Most monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern Mobile County, near <a href="Bayou%20La%20Batre%2C%20Alabama">Bayou La Batre</a>. This area has attracted an <a href="Indochina%20refugee%20crisis">influx of refugees from Cambodia, Laos, and Vietnam</a> during the 1970s and thereafter. The four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre, include Chua Chanh Giac, Wat Buddharaksa, and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan.

The first community of adherents of the <a href="Baha%27i%20Faith">Baha'i Faith</a> in Alabama was founded in 1896 by Paul K. Dealy, who moved from Chicago to <a href="Fairhope">Fairhope</a>. Baha'i Centers in Alabama exist in <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham, Alabama</a>, <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville, Alabama</a>, and <a href="Florence%2C%20Alabama">Florence, Alabama</a>.

Health.
A <a href="Centers%20for%20Disease%20Control%20and%20Prevention">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama was a problem, with most counties having over 29% of adults obese, except for ten which had a rate between 26% and 29%. Residents of the state, along with those in five other states, were least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time. Alabama, and the southeastern U.S. in general, has one of the highest incidences of adult onset <a href="diabetes%20type%20II">diabetes</a> in the country, exceeding 10% of adults.

Economy.
The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and <a href="fabrication%20%28metal%29">fabrication</a>. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the state's gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.

Non-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.

According to the U.S. <a href="Bureau%20of%20Economic%20Analysis">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, the 2008 total <a href="gross%20state%20product">gross state product</a> was $170 billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama's 2012 GDP increased 1.2% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information. In 2010, per capita income for the state was $22,984.

The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 5.8% in April 2015. This compared to a nationwide seasonally adjusted rate of 5.4%.

Alabama has no state minimum wage and uses the federal minimum wage of $7.25. In February 2016, the state passed legislation that prevents Alabama municipalities from raising the minimum wage in their locality. The legislation voids a Birmingham city ordinance that was to raise the city's minimum wage to $10.10.

Largest employers.
The five employers that employed the most employees in Alabama in April 2011 were:

The next twenty largest employers, , included:
Agriculture.
Alabama's agricultural outputs include poultry and eggs, cattle, fish, plant nursery items, peanuts, cotton, grains such as <a href="Corn%20production%20in%20the%20United%20States">corn</a> and <a href="sorghum">sorghum</a>, vegetables, milk, <a href="soybean">soybean</a>s, and peaches. Although known as "<a href="List%20of%20U.S.%20state%20nicknames">The Cotton State</a>", Alabama ranks between eighth and tenth in <a href="Cotton%20production%20in%20the%20United%20States">national cotton production</a>, according to various reports, with <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, <a href="Georgia%20%28U.S.%20state%29">Georgia</a> and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a> comprising the top three.

Industry.
Alabama's industrial outputs include iron and steel products (including cast-iron and steel pipe); paper, <a href="lumber">lumber</a>, and wood products; mining (mostly coal); plastic products; cars and trucks; and <a href="apparel">apparel</a>. In addition, Alabama produces <a href="aerospace">aerospace</a> and <a href="electronics">electronic</a> products, mostly in the <a href="Huntsville%2C%20Alabama">Huntsville</a> area, the location of <a href="NASA">NASA</a>'s <a href="George%20C.%20Marshall%20Space%20Flight%20Center">George C. Marshall Space Flight Center</a> and the <a href="United%20States%20Army%20Materiel%20Command">U.S. Army Materiel Command</a>, headquartered at <a href="Redstone%20Arsenal">Redstone Arsenal</a>.
A great deal of Alabama's economic growth since the 1990s has been due to the state's expanding automotive manufacturing industry. Located in the state are <a href="Honda%20Manufacturing%20of%20Alabama">Honda Manufacturing of Alabama</a>, <a href="Hyundai%20Motor%20Manufacturing%20Alabama">Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama</a>, <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20U.S.%20International">Mercedes-Benz U.S. International</a>, and <a href="Toyota%20Motor%20Manufacturing%20Alabama">Toyota Motor Manufacturing Alabama</a>, as well as their various suppliers. Since 1993, the automobile industry has generated more than 67,800 new jobs in the state. Alabama currently ranks 4th in the nation for vehicle exports.

Automakers accounted for approximately a third of the industrial expansion in the state in 2012. The eight models produced at the state's auto factories totaled combined sales of 74,335 vehicles for 2012. The strongest model sales during this period were the <a href="Hyundai%20Elantra">Hyundai Elantra</a> compact car, the <a href="Mercedes-Benz%20GL-Class">Mercedes-Benz GL-Class</a> sport utility vehicle and the <a href="Honda%20Ridgeline">Honda Ridgeline</a> sport utility truck.
Steel producers <a href="Outokumpu">Outokumpu</a>, <a href="Nucor">Nucor</a>, <a href="SSAB">SSAB</a>, <a href="ThyssenKrupp">ThyssenKrupp</a>, and <a href="U.S.%20Steel">U.S. Steel</a> have facilities in Alabama and employ over 10,000 people. In May 2007, German steelmaker ThyssenKrupp selected <a href="Calvert%2C%20Alabama">Calvert</a> in <a href="Mobile%20County%2C%20Alabama">Mobile County</a> for a 4.65 billion combined <a href="stainless%20steel">stainless</a> and <a href="carbon%20steel">carbon steel</a> processing facility. ThyssenKrupp's stainless steel division, Inoxum, including the stainless portion of the Calvert plant, was sold to Finnish stainless steel company Outokumpu in 2012. The remaining portion of the ThyssenKrupp plant had final bids submitted by <a href="ArcelorMittal">ArcelorMittal</a> and <a href="Nippon%20Steel">Nippon Steel</a> for $1.6 billion in March 2013. <a href="Companhia%20Sider%C3%BArgica%20Nacional">Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional</a> submitted a combined bid for the mill at Calvert, plus a majority stake in the ThyssenKrupp mill in Brazil, for $3.8 billion. In July 2013, the plant was sold to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel.

The <a href="Hunt%20Refining%20Company">Hunt Refining Company</a>, a subsidiary of Hunt Consolidated, Inc., is based in Tuscaloosa and operates a refinery there. The company also operates terminals in Mobile, Melvin, and <a href="Moundville%2C%20Alabama">Moundville</a>. <a href="JVC">JVC America, Inc.</a> operates an <a href="optical%20disc">optical disc</a> replication and packaging plant in Tuscaloosa.

The <a href="Goodyear%20Tire%20and%20Rubber%20Company">Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company</a> operates a large plant in <a href="Gadsden%2C%20Alabama">Gadsden</a> that employs about 1,400 people. It has been in operation since 1929.

Construction of an <a href="Airbus%20A320%20family">Airbus A320 family</a> aircraft assembly plant in Mobile was formally announced by <a href="Airbus">Airbus</a> CEO <a href="Fabrice%20Br%C3%A9gier">Fabrice Brégier</a> from the Mobile Convention Center on July 2, 2012. The plans include a $600 million factory at the <a href="Brookley%20Aeroplex">Brookley Aeroplex</a> for the assembly of the A319, A320 and A321 aircraft. Construction began in 2013, with plans for it to become operable by 2015 and produce up to 50 aircraft per year by 2017. The assembly plant is the company's first factory to be built within the United States. It was announced on February 1, 2013, that Airbus had hired Alabama-based <a href="Hoar%20Construction">Hoar Construction</a> to oversee construction of the facility.

Tourism.
An estimated 20 million tourists visit the state each year. Over 100,000 of these are from other countries, including from Canada, the United Kingdom, Germany and Japan. In 2006, 22.3 million tourists spent $8.3 billion providing an estimated 162,000 jobs in the state. Some of the most popular areas include the Rocket City of Huntsville, the beaches along the Gulf, and the state's capitol in Montgomery.

Healthcare.
<a href="UAB%20Hospital">UAB Hospital</a> is the only <a href="trauma%20center">Level I trauma center</a> in Alabama. UAB is the largest state government employer in Alabama, with a workforce of about 18,000.

Banking.
Alabama has the headquarters of <a href="Regions%20Financial%20Corporation">Regions Financial Corporation</a>, <a href="BBVA%20Compass">BBVA Compass</a>, <a href="Superior%20Bancorp">Superior Bancorp</a> and the former <a href="Colonial%20Bancgroup">Colonial Bancgroup</a>. Birmingham-based Compass Banchshares was acquired by Spanish-based <a href="BBVA">BBVA</a> in September 2007, although the headquarters of BBVA Compass remains in Birmingham. In November 2006, Regions Financial completed its merger with <a href="AmSouth%20Bancorporation">AmSouth Bancorporation</a>, which was also headquartered in Birmingham. <a href="SouthTrust%20Corporation">SouthTrust Corporation</a>, another large bank headquartered in Birmingham, was acquired by <a href="Wachovia">Wachovia</a> in 2004 for $14.3 billion.

The city still has major operations for Wachovia and its now post-operating bank <a href="Wells%20Fargo">Wells Fargo</a>, which includes a regional headquarters, an operations center campus and a $400 million data center. Nearly a dozen smaller banks are also headquartered in the Birmingham, such as Superior Bancorp, <a href="ServisFirst">ServisFirst</a> and New South Federal Savings Bank. Birmingham also serves as the headquarters for several large investment management companies, including <a href="Harbert%20Management%20Corporation">Harbert Management Corporation</a>.

Harbert International</a>, which all routinely are included in the Engineering News-Record lists of top design, international construction, and engineering firms. (Rust International was acquired in 2000 by <a href="Washington%20Group%20International">Washington Group International</a>, which was in turn acquired by San-Francisco based <a href="URS%20Corporation">URS Corporation</a> in 2007.)

Law and government.
State government.
The foundational document for Alabama's government is the <a href="Alabama%20Constitution">Alabama Constitution</a>, which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the <a href="United%20States%20Constitution">United States Constitution</a>.

There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution. Critics argue that Alabama's constitution maintains highly centralized power with the state legislature, leaving practically no power in local hands. Most counties do not have home rule. Any policy changes proposed in different areas of the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.

Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches. The <a href="legislative%20branch">legislative branch</a> is the <a href="Alabama%20Legislature">Alabama Legislature</a>, a <a href="bicameral">bicameral</a> assembly composed of the <a href="Alabama%20House%20of%20Representatives">Alabama House of Representatives</a>, with 105 members, and the <a href="Alabama%20Senate">Alabama Senate</a>, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican Party</a> currently holds a majority in both houses of the <a href="Alabama%20Legislature">Legislature</a>. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).

Until 1964, the state elected state senators on a geographic basis by county, with one per county. It had not redistricted congressional districts since passage of its constitution in 1901; as a result, urbanized areas were grossly underrepresented. It had not changed legislative districts to reflect the decennial censuses, either. In "<a href="Reynolds%20v.%20Sims">Reynolds v. Sims</a>" (1964), the US Supreme Court implemented the principle of "<a href="one%20man%2C%20one%20vote">one man, one vote</a>", ruling that congressional districts had to be reapportioned based on censuses (as the state already included in its constitution but had not implemented.) Further, the court ruled that both houses of bicameral state legislatures had to be apportioned by population, as there was no constitutional basis for states to have geographically based systems.

At that time, Alabama and many other states had to change their legislative districting, as many across the country had systems that underrepresented urban areas and districts. This had caused decades of underinvestment in such areas. For instance, Birmingham and Jefferson County taxes had supplied one-third of the state budget, but Jefferson County received only 1/67th of state services in funding. Through the legislative delegations, the Alabama legislature kept control of county governments.

The <a href="executive%20branch">executive branch</a> is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the <a href="Governor%20of%20Alabama">Governor of Alabama</a>. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the <a href="Attorney%20General%20of%20Alabama">Attorney General of Alabama</a>, the <a href="Alabama%20Secretary%20of%20State">Alabama Secretary of State</a>, the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Treasurer">Alabama State Treasurer</a>, and the <a href="State%20Auditor%20of%20Alabama">State Auditor of Alabama</a>. The current <a href="Governor%20of%20Alabama">governor</a> of the state is <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> <a href="Kay%20Ivey">Kay Ivey</a>. The office of <a href="List%20of%20Lieutenant%20Governors%20of%20Alabama">lieutenant governor</a> is currently vacant.

The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials, such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers, take office the following January.

The <a href="Judiciary">judicial branch</a> is responsible for interpreting the <a href="Alabama%20Constitution">Constitution</a> and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The <a href="State%20supreme%20court">state's highest court</a> is the <a href="Supreme%20Court%20of%20Alabama">Supreme Court of Alabama</a>. Alabama uses partisan elections to select judges. Since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized. The current <a href="chief%20justice">chief justice</a> of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican <a href="Roy%20Moore">Roy Moore</a>. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate <a href="appellate%20court">appellate court</a>s, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four <a href="trial%20court">trial court</a>s: the circuit court (trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts.

Some critics believe that the election of judges has contributed to an exceedingly high rate of executions. Alabama has the highest per capita <a href="Capital%20punishment%20in%20Alabama">death penalty rate</a> in the country. In some years, it imposes more death sentences than does <a href="Texas">Texas</a>, a state which has a population five times larger. Some of its cases have been highly controversial; the Supreme Court has overturned 24 convictions in death penalty cases. It is the only state that still allows judges to override jury decisions in whether or not to use a death sentence; in 10 cases judges overturned sentences of <a href="life%20imprisonment%20without%20parole">life imprisonment without parole</a> (LWOP) that were voted unanimously by juries.

Taxes.
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent <a href="State%20income%20tax">personal income tax</a>, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their <a href="Income%20tax%20in%20the%20United%20States">federal income tax</a> from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the <a href="standard%20deduction">standard deduction</a>. Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the <a href="Federal%20Insurance%20Contributions%20Act%20tax">Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax</a> (Social Security and Medicare tax).

The state's general sales tax rate is 4%. Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay an 11% tax on a meal. , sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods, and one of two states (the other being neighboring Mississippi) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low-income families. (Most states exempt groceries from sales tax or apply a lower tax rate.)

Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the United States. Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line. Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.

The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country. <a href="Property%20tax">Property tax</a>es are the lowest in the U.S. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.

Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million.

County and local governments.
Alabama has 67 <a href="county%20%28United%20States%29">counties</a>. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission. It also has limited executive authority in the county. Because of the constraints of the <a href="Alabama%20Constitution">Alabama Constitution</a>, which centralizes power in the state legislature, only seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have limited <a href="home%20rule">home rule</a>. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies approved, ranging from waste disposal to land use zoning. The cumbersome process results in local jurisdictions being unable to manage their problems, and the state legislators being buried in local county issues.

The state legislature has retained power over local governments by refusing to pass a constitutional amendment establishing <a href="home%20rule">home rule</a> for counties, as recommended by the 1973 Alabama Constitutional Commission. Legislative delegations retain certain powers over each county. United States Supreme Court decisions in "<a href="Baker%20v.%20Carr">Baker v. Carr</a>" (1964) required that both houses have districts established on the basis of population, and redistricted after each census, in order to implement the principle of "one man, one vote". Before that, each county was represented by one state senator, leading to under-representation in the state senate for more urbanized, populous counties. The rural bias of the state legislature, which had also failed to redistrict seats in the state house, affected politics well into the 20th century, failing to recognize the rise of industrial cities and urbanized areas.

"The lack of home rule for counties in Alabama has resulted in the proliferation of local legislation permitting counties to do things not authorized by the state constitution. Alabama's constitution has been amended more than 700 times, and almost one-third of the amendments are local in nature, applying to only one county or city. A significant part of each legislative session is spent on local legislation, taking away time and attention of legislators from issues of statewide importance."

Alabama is an <a href="alcoholic%20beverage%20control%20state">alcoholic beverage control state</a>, meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The <a href="Alabama%20Alcoholic%20Beverage%20Control%20Board">Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board</a> controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. Twenty-five of the 67 counties are "<a href="Dry%20county">dry counties</a>" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.

Politics.
During <a href="Reconstruction%20era%20of%20the%20United%20States">Reconstruction</a> following the <a href="American%20Civil%20War">American Civil War</a>, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the <a href="Third%20Military%20District">Third Military District</a> under <a href="John%20Pope%20%28military%20officer%29">General John Pope</a>. In 1874, the political coalition of white Democrats known as the <a href="Redeemers">Redeemers</a> took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African-American vote through violence, fraud and intimidation.

After 1890, a coalition of White Democratic politicians passed laws to <a href="racial%20segregation">segregate</a> and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised African Americans resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than African Americans had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.

From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state during urbanization and industrialization of certain areas. As counties were the basis of election districts, the result was a rural minority that dominated state politics through nearly three-quarters of the century, until a series of federal court cases required redistricting in 1972 to meet equal representation.

Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Movement">Civil Rights Movement</a>, when whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Governor <a href="George%20Wallace">George Wallace</a>, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure who vowed to maintain segregation. Only after passage of the federal <a href="Civil%20Rights%20Act%20of%201964">Civil Rights Act of 1964</a> and <a href="Voting%20Rights%20Act%20of%201965">Voting Rights Act of 1965</a> did African Americans regain the ability to exercise suffrage, among other civil rights. In many jurisdictions, they continued to be excluded from representation by <a href="at-large">at-large</a> electoral systems, which allowed the majority of the population to dominate elections. Some changes at the county level have occurred following court challenges to establish <a href="single-member%20districts">single-member districts</a> that enable a more diverse representation among county boards.

In 2007, the <a href="Alabama%20Legislature">Alabama Legislature</a> passed, and Republican Governor <a href="Bob%20Riley">Bob Riley</a> signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Capitol">Alabama State Capitol</a>, which housed Congress of the <a href="Confederate%20States%20of%20America">Confederate States of America</a>.

In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years, after a nearly complete realignment of political parties, who represent different visions in the 21st century.

Elections.
State elections.
With the <a href="Disfranchisement%20after%20Reconstruction%20era">disfranchisement of African Americans</a> in 1901, the state became part of the "<a href="Solid%20South">Solid South</a>", a system in which the <a href="Democratic%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Democratic Party</a> operated as effectively the only viable political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party <a href="primary%20election">primary</a>, with generally only token <a href="Republican%20Party%20%28United%20States%29">Republican</a> challengers running in the General Election. Since the mid to late-20th century, however, there has been a realignment among the two major political parties, and white conservatives started shifting to the Republican Party. In Alabama, majority-white districts are now expected to regularly elect Republican candidates to federal, state and local office.

Members of the nine seats on the <a href="Alabama%20Supreme%20Court">Alabama Supreme Court</a> and all ten seats on the state appellate courts are elected to office. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, <a href="Ernest%20C.%20Hornsby">Ernest C. Hornsby</a>, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican <a href="Perry%20O.%20Hooper%2C%20Sr.">Perry O. Hooper, Sr.</a>. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.

In the early 21st century, Republicans hold all seven of the <a href="Political%20party%20strength%20in%20Alabama">statewide elected executive</a> branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Board%20of%20Education">Alabama State Board of Education</a>. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature, giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. The last remaining statewide Democrat, who served on the Alabama Public Service Commission was defeated in 2012.

Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since the end of Reconstruction, when Republicans generally represented Reconstruction government, including the newly emancipated <a href="freedmen">freedmen</a> who had gained the franchise. The two GOP Lt. Governors were Steve Windom (1999–2003) and the current Lt. Governor, <a href="Kay%20Ivey">Kay Ivey</a>, who was elected in 2010 and re-elected in 2014.

Local elections.
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Many rural counties have voters who are majority Democrats, resulting in local elections being decided in the Democratic primary. Similarly many metropolitan and suburban counties are majority-Republican and elections are effectively decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.

Alabama's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan, <a href="at-large">at-large</a> races, and Democrats still retain the narrow majority of those posts. The current split is 35 <a href="Alabama%20Democratic%20Party">Democrats</a>, 31 <a href="Alabama%20Republican%20Party">Republicans</a>, and one Independent Fayette. However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties. The majority of Republican sheriffs have been elected in the more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. , the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in <a href="Morgan%20County%2C%20Alabama">Morgan County, Alabama</a>, and ten African-American sheriffs.

Federal elections.
The state's two <a href="United%20States%20Senate">U.S. senators</a> are <a href="Luther%20Strange">Luther Strange</a> and <a href="Richard%20Shelby">Richard C. Shelby</a>, both Republicans. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties immediately following the November 1994 general election.

In the <a href="United%20States%20House%20of%20Representatives">U.S. House of Representatives</a>, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (<a href="Bradley%20Byrne">Bradley Byrne</a>, <a href="Mike%20D.%20Rogers">Mike D. Rogers</a>, <a href="Robert%20Aderholt">Robert Aderholt</a>, <a href="Morris%20J.%20Brooks">Morris J. Brooks</a>, <a href="Martha%20Roby">Martha Roby</a>, and <a href="Gary%20Palmer%20%28politician%29">Gary Palmer</a>) and one Democrat: <a href="Terri%20Sewell">Terri Sewell</a> who represents the <a href="Black%20Belt%20%28region%20of%20Alabama%29">Black Belt</a> as well as most of the predominantly black portions of <a href="Birmingham%2C%20Alabama">Birmingham</a>, <a href="Tuscaloosa%2C%20Alabama">Tuscaloosa</a> and <a href="Montgomery%2C%20Alabama">Montgomery</a>.
Education.
Primary and secondary education.
Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the <a href="Alabama%20State%20Board%20of%20Education">Alabama State Board of Education</a> as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.

Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National <a href="No%20Child%20Left%20Behind">No Child Left Behind</a> law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.

While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate—75%—is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after <a href="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, <a href="Louisiana">Louisiana</a> and <a href="Mississippi">Mississippi</a>). The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.

Although unusual in the West, <a href="school%20corporal%20punishment">school corporal punishment</a> is not uncommon in Alabama, with 27,260 public school students <a href="paddle%20%28spanking%29">paddled</a> at least one time, according to government data for the 2011–2012 school year. The rate of school corporal punishment in Alabama is surpassed only by Mississippi and Arkansas.

Colleges and universities.
Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities.

Achilles

In <a href="Greek%20mythology">Greek mythology</a>, Achilles (, ; ) was a <a href="Greeks">Greek</a> hero of the <a href="Trojan%20War">Trojan War</a> and the central character and greatest warrior of <a href="Homer">Homer</a>'s "<a href="Iliad">Iliad</a>". His mother was the immortal <a href="nymph">nymph</a> <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a>, and his father, the mortal <a href="Peleus">Peleus</a>, was the king of the <a href="Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>.

Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero <a href="Hector">Hector</a> outside the gates of <a href="Troy">Troy</a>. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the "Iliad", other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a>, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by <a href="Statius">Statius</a> in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Alluding to these legends, the term "<a href="Achilles%20heel">Achilles heel</a>" has come to mean a point of weakness, especially in someone or something with a strong constitution.

Etymology.
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of (') "grief" and (') "a people, tribe, nation." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the "Iliad" (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of "" ("glory", usually glory in war).

"Laos" has been construed by <a href="Gregory%20Nagy">Gregory Nagy</a>, following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a <a href="muster%20%28military%29">muster</a>. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: when the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.

<a href="Robert%20S.%20P.%20Beekes">R. S. P. Beekes</a> has suggested a <a href="Pre-Greek">Pre-Greek</a> origin of the name.

The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC. It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία ("Achilleía") attested in Attica in the 4th century BC (<a href="Inscriptiones%20Graecae">IG</a> II² 1617) and, in the form "Achillia", on a <a href="Female%20gladiator%23Halicarnassus">stele in Halicarnassus</a> as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon".

Birth.
Achilles was the son of the <a href="Nereid">Nereid</a> <a href="Thetis">Thetis</a> and <a href="Peleus">Peleus</a>, the king of the <a href="Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a>. <a href="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="Poseidon">Poseidon</a> had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until <a href="Prometheus">Prometheus</a>, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.

There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in "<a href="Argonautica">Argonautica</a>" (iv.760) Zeus' sister and wife <a href="Hera">Hera</a> alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god <a href="Nereus">Nereus</a>, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.
According to the "<a href="Achilleid">Achilleid</a>", written by <a href="Statius">Statius</a> in the 1st century AD, and to no surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal, by dipping him in the river <a href="Styx">Styx</a>. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him, his heel (see <a href="Achilles%20heel">Achilles heel</a>, <a href="Achilles%27%20tendon">Achilles' tendon</a>). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in <a href="ambrosia">ambrosia</a> and put him on top of a fire, to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.

However, none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the "Iliad" Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the <a href="Paeonian">Paeonian</a> hero <a href="Asteropaeus">Asteropaeus</a>, son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood".

Also, in the fragmentary poems of the <a href="Epic%20Cycle">Epic Cycle</a> in which we can find description of the hero's death, "<a href="Cypria">Cypria</a>" (unknown author), "<a href="Aithiopis">Aithiopis</a>" by <a href="Arctinus%20of%20Miletus">Arctinus of Miletus</a>, "<a href="Little%20Iliad">Little Iliad</a>" by Lesche of Mytilene, "<a href="Iliou%20persis">Iliou persis</a>" by <a href="Arctinus%20of%20Miletus">Arctinus of Miletus</a>, there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body.

Peleus entrusted Achilles to <a href="Chiron">Chiron</a> the <a href="Centaur">Centaur</a>, on Mt. <a href="Pelion">Pelion</a>, to be reared.

Achilles in the Trojan War.
The first two lines of the "Iliad" read:

Achilles' consuming rage is at times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled.

Thetis foretold that her son's fate was either to gain glory and die young, or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity. Achilles chose the former, and decided to take part in the Trojan war. According to the "Iliad", Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 <a href="Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a> (Book 2). He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon (Book 16).

Telephus.
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in <a href="Mysia">Mysia</a>, ruled by King <a href="Telephus">Telephus</a>. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that "he that wounded shall heal". Guided by the oracle, he arrived at <a href="Argos">Argos</a>, where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy.

According to other reports in <a href="Euripides">Euripides</a>' lost play about Telephus, he went to <a href="Aulis%20%28ancient%20Greece%29">Aulis</a> pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held <a href="Orestes%20%28mythology%29">Orestes</a> for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed.

Troilus.
According to the "<a href="Cypria">Cypria</a>" (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the <a href="Achaeans%20%28Homer%29">Achaeans</a> desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of <a href="Aeneas">Aeneas</a>, sacked neighboring cities and killed <a href="Troilus">Troilus</a>.

In <a href="Dares%20Phrygius">Dares Phrygius</a>' "Account of the Destruction of Troy", the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, <a href="Troilus">Troilus</a> was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King <a href="Priam">Priam</a>'s (or sometimes <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>) and <a href="Hecuba">Hecuba</a>'s five legitimate sons. Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister <a href="Polyxena">Polyxena</a>, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who, refusing to yield, instead found himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo. Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege. Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the <a href="First%20Vatican%20Mythographer">First Vatican Mythographer</a> claimed, Troy would have been invincible.

Achilles in the "Iliad".
Homer's "Iliad" is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath is the central theme of the poem. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decade-long war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after being dishonored by <a href="Agamemnon">Agamemnon</a>, the commander of the <a href="Achaeans%20%28Homer%29">Achaean</a> forces. Agamemnon has taken a woman named <a href="Chryseis">Chryseis</a> as his slave. Her father <a href="Chryses">Chryses</a>, a priest of <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a>, begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses, and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet <a href="Calchas">Calchas</a> correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so, and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize <a href="Briseis%2C%20daughter%20of%20Briseus">Briseis, daughter of Briseus</a> be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away (and, as he says later, because he loves Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At the same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor.

As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, <a href="Nestor%20%28mythology%29">Nestor</a> declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sends <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and two other chieftains, <a href="Ajax%20%28mythology%29">Ajax</a> and <a href="Phoenix%20%28son%20of%20Amyntor%29">Phoenix</a>, to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.

The Trojans, led by <a href="Hector">Hector</a>, subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, <a href="Patroclus">Patroclus</a> leads the <a href="Myrmidons">Myrmidons</a> into battle, wearing Achilles' armor, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.

After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from <a href="Antilochus">Antilochus</a>, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades <a href="Hephaestus">Hephaestus</a> to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing, which was taken by Hector. The new armor includes the <a href="Shield%20of%20Achilles">Shield of Achilles</a>, described in great detail in the poem.

Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field, killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god <a href="Scamander">Scamander</a>, who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by <a href="Hera">Hera</a> and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before <a href="Athena">Athena</a>, in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, <a href="Deiphobus">Deiphobus</a>, persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that "my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me". Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot. After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral, Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in his honor.

With the assistance of the god <a href="Hermes">Hermes</a>, Hector's father, <a href="Priam">Priam</a>, goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral. The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.

Penthesilea.
Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the <a href="Amazons">Amazonian</a> warrior queen <a href="Penthesilea">Penthesilea</a>, but later grieved over her death. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.

Memnon, and the fall of Achilles.
Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion was Nestor's son <a href="Antilochus">Antilochus</a>. When <a href="Memnon%20%28mythology%29">Memnon</a>, king of <a href="Ethiopia%20%28mythology%29">Ethiopia</a> slew Antilochus, Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.

Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the "Iliad"'s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the <a href="Epic%20Cycle">cyclic epic</a> "<a href="Aethiopis">Aethiopis</a>", which was composed after the "Iliad", possibly in the 7th century B.C. The "Aethiopis" is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.
The death of Achilles, as predicted by <a href="Hector">Hector</a> with his dying breath, was brought about by <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a> with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.
All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of <a href="Patroclus">Patroclus</a>, and funeral games were held. He was represented in the "Aethiopis" as living after his death in the island of <a href="Leuke">Leuke</a> at the mouth of the river <a href="Danube">Danube</a>.

Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, <a href="Polyxena">Polyxena</a>. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.

In the Odyssey, Agamemnon informs Achilles of his burial mound while they are receiving the dead suitors in Hades. He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the Ocean. Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.

Paris was later killed by <a href="Philoctetes">Philoctetes</a> using the enormous bow of <a href="Heracles">Heracles</a>.

Fate of Achilles' armor.
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between <a href="Odysseus">Odysseus</a> and <a href="Ajax%20%28mythology%29">Telamonian Ajax</a> (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to <a href="Neoptolemus">Neoptolemus</a>, the son of Achilles.

A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of <a href="Phaselis">Phaselis</a>, Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the "Iliad" with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear. However, it was shown in the time of <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> in the 2nd century AD.

Achilles, Ajax and a game of "petteia".
Numerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions. At some point in the war, Achilles and <a href="Ajax%20%28mythology%29">Ajax</a> were playing a <a href="board%20game">board game</a> ("petteia"). They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle. The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes, who were saved only by an intervention of Athena.

Achilles and Patroclus.
The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the "Iliad", it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. <a href="Homer">Homer</a> does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers. Despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from <a href="classical%20antiquity">classical antiquity</a> to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the <a href="Pederasty%20in%20ancient%20Greece">Greek custom of "paiderasteia"</a>. In Plato's "Symposium", the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover. But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish <a href="heterosexual">heterosexual</a> and <a href="homosexual">homosexual</a>, and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women.

Worship of Achilles in antiquity.
There was an archaic <a href="heroic%20cult">heroic cult</a> of Achilles on the <a href="Snake%20Island%20%28Black%20Sea%29">White Island, "Leuce"</a>, in the <a href="Black%20Sea">Black Sea</a> off the modern coasts of <a href="Romania">Romania</a> and <a href="Ukraine">Ukraine</a>, with a temple and an <a href="oracle">oracle</a> which survived into the Roman period.

In the lost epic " <a href="Aithiopis">Aithiopis</a>", a continuation of the "Iliad" attributed to <a href="Arctinus">Arktinus of Miletos</a>, Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a <a href="tumulus">tumulus</a> for him and celebrated funeral games.

<a href="Pliny%20the%20Elder">Pliny's</a> "<a href="Natural%20History%20%28Pliny%29">Natural History</a>" mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident ("Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara"), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from <a href="Peuce">Peuce</a> by the <a href="Danube%20Delta">Danube Delta</a>, and the temple there. <a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a> has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue". Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.

<a href="Pomponius%20Mela">Pomponius Mela</a> tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister. The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called "Leuce" "because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor".

The "<a href="Periplus%20Ponti%20Euxini">Periplus of the Euxine Sea</a>" gives the following details: "It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships". (quoted in Densuşianu)

The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the <a href="Black%20Sea">Pontic Sea</a> but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.

Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as "Pontarches" the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia (<a href="Stephanus%20Byzantinus">Stephanus Byzantinus</a>), Achilleios in Laconia (<a href="Pausanias%20%28geographer%29">Pausanias</a>, III.25,4) <a href="Nicolae%20Densu%C5%9Fianu">Nicolae Densuşianu</a> (Densuşianu 1913) even though he recognized Achilles in the name of <a href="Aquileia">Aquileia</a> and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia ("Achileii"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law."

Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the <a href="Delphi">Delphic Pythia</a> sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound. <a href="Ammianus%20Marcellinus">Ammianus Marcellinus</a> (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters ("aquae") on the island.

Other stories.
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of <a href="Lycomedes">Lycomedes</a>, king of <a href="Skyros">Skyros</a>. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name "Pyrrha" (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes' daughter <a href="Deidamia%20%28mythology%29">Deidamia</a>, whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, <a href="Neoptolemus">Neoptolemus</a> (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet <a href="Calchas">Calchas</a> that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.

In book 11 of Homer's "<a href="Odyssey">Odyssey</a>", Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the <a href="Greek%20colonies">Greek colonies</a> on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical "White Island" which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.

The kings of the <a href="Despotate%20of%20Epirus">Epirus</a> claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. <a href="Alexander%20the%20Great">Alexander the Great</a>, son of the Epirote princess <a href="Olympias">Olympias</a>, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at <a href="Achilleion%20%28Troad%29%23Tomb%20of%20Achilles">Achilleion</a> while passing Troy. In AD 216 the Roman Emperor <a href="Caracalla">Caracalla</a>, while on his way to war against <a href="Parthia">Parthia</a>, emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.

Achilles fought and killed the <a href="Amazons">Amazon</a> <a href="Helene%20%28Amazon%29">Helene</a>. Some also said he married <a href="Medea">Medea</a>, and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades – as Hera promised Thetis in <a href="Apollonius%20of%20Rhodes">Apollonius</a>' "<a href="Argonautica">Argonautica</a>". In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive <a href="Briseis">Briseis</a>.

Achilles in Greek tragedy.
The <a href="tragedy">Greek tragedian</a> <a href="Aeschylus">Aeschylus</a> wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title "Achilleis" by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of <a href="Hector">Hector</a> and eventual death when an arrow shot by <a href="Paris%20%28mythology%29">Paris</a> and guided by <a href="Apollo">Apollo</a> punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the "Achilleis" and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the "Achilleis" trilogy, "The Myrmidons", focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today. In Plato's "Symposium", Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.

The tragedian <a href="Sophocles">Sophocles</a> also wrote "The Lovers of Achilles", a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.

Towards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; Euripides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in "<a href="Hecuba%20%28play%29">Hecuba</a>", "<a href="Electra%20%28Euripides%29">Electra</a>", and "<a href="Iphigenia%20in%20Aulis">Iphigenia in Aulis</a>".
